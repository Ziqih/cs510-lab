# Food, family and diabetes: how to say no politely
sometimes be hard to resist persuasive family members...
Eating together as a family or with friends is often an enjoyable social
activity and a great way to bond. But if you’re trying to maintain a healthy,
balanced diet to help manage your diabetes, it can get a bit awkward
sometimes, as you might not want to eat something but feel that you can’t say
no without causing offence.In the first of a new series about the psychology
of food and eating, Dr Jen Nash shares her tips to identify when social eating
is having a negative effect on your diet – and what you can do about it.
If you cast your mind back over the last few weeks and think about the reasons
why you ate, it was likely that many of your decisions around food had little,
if anything, to do with how hungry you were.
This is because hunger is only one of many reasons why we choose to eat. In
our food abundant cultures, there are lots of layers and meanings to eating,
and the family and social context is a key one. We celebrate, bond and
More than this, food has become a way of communicating. We can say things with
food that might be difficult to say in words. In many of our families, it may
be challenging to say, ‘I care about you’, ‘I’m worried about you’ or ‘I love
you’, but it can be so much easier to say ‘You’ve had a hard day, let’s get a
takeaway tonight’, or ‘I’ll cook you your favourite meal to take your mind off
Of course, there’s nothing wrong with using food in these ways; in fact it is
very human to – the difficulty is when the tendency to use food for reasons
other than hunger becomes the default and is done unconsciously. If you’re
living with diabetes and trying to manage both your blood glucose levels and
your weight, you may need help to say no, or to make a different choice.
To help you think about food in your household, here are three types of family
1. People you feel you can’t say no to.
2. People who seem to derail your efforts to change.
3. People with whom you connect through food.
Do you notice any of these types of people in your life? Or do you recognise
yourself in any of the descriptions? There is no blame attached to becoming
aware of this. We are all generally doing the best we can, and the aim is to
raise our awareness of the impact others might be having on us, and make
So, how do we decline food when it is offered within our families? Here are
### People you feel you can’t say no to
In many of our cultures, food is used as a way of showing love and care. So,
if there are people in your family who often offer you food, it’s more than
likely they’ll be doing so for positive and loving reasons. It can be useful
to think about what might be motivating your family member, so that you can
use this motivation to help you both get what you want and need. Here are a
* Someone may offer you food so they can nurture or care for you.
* Try: saying ‘no, thank you – but what I’ve had was delicious and I feel so well-fed, thank you!’ Make and maintain eye contact as you respond and use a firm/assertive tone.
* Someone may offer you food so they feel like a good host.
* It’s the job of the host to ‘give’ to their guests, so try allowing the person to get you something else: say ‘no thank you but I would love a top up of my drink’.
* You could also try taking what is offered but leaving it on your plate.
### People who seem to derail your efforts to change
There is often a reaction in the family when one person starts to lose weight.
Weight loss can be threatening – change of any sort involves risk and a
feeling of not being in control of the outcome. Family members may both love
us and feel threatened when we change for the better. Partners may worry ‘will
they still find me attractive?’, or ‘will they start to judge me if they lose
weight and I don’t?’ So, how can you say no to family members who may be
preventing you from making progress by continuing to offer you food?
* Remember that they are not likely to be acting maliciously, but are rather feeling threatened by or fearful of the changes you are making.
* Consider whether it’s possible to talk to your loved one. Pick your moment – better to wait until neither of you are eating or preparing food. You will find your individual style of expressing yourself, but here is Robert’s story
Robert was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes a year ago and wanted to lose a lot
of weight. He had set a realistic weight loss goal and was pleased with his
progress. His wife, Linda, who also wanted to lose weight but hadn’t made any
changes yet, was supportive of his efforts. However, she decided to take up a
course in cake decorating, so every week she’d return home from her class with
her beautiful creations, which of course, Robert found hard to resist. Not
only did they look delicious, but he felt that by refusing a cake he was not
being supportive of her new interest. He felt quite unsure about what to do,
and for the first few weeks it was easier to just eat the cakes than say
anything (and they were wonderful, so it wasn’t too difficult!).
After a while, he decided to talk to Linda and broached the topic when they
were out for a walk. He told Linda that, although he loved that she was
enjoying her cake decorating class, he felt a bit torn each week. He really
enjoyed eating the cakes, but he was also proud that he’d been losing weight,
and felt that he was getting a bit off track when he ate the cakes. He
explained that he wanted to support her, but wanted to find another way to do
so. He wasn’t much of a photographer but had been thinking he would like to
get better, so suggested he could just have a taste, and then take photos of
the cakes that they could share with family and friends. Linda was quiet at
first, but agreed that this was a good approach for both of them.
Even if it’s not possible to find a creative solution like Robert’s, just
naming what’s going on is often enough to create different conversations and
## People with whom you connect through food
For many of us, as much as we may love our relatives, we might not actually
have very much in common with them! And that’s ok; family is more than simply
shared interests. However, this means that food and eating may easily become
one of the few ways we can relate.
* Try: following Robert’s example and think about having a conversation with your loved one about other ways you could spend time together. Try saying 'I’ve noticed that whenever I come over, we generally spend our time eating. I wonder if there are other things we could try out doing to spend time together?'
* Try: thinking about other ways you could relate – what are some shared interests you could re-discover or try out? That way, you can pre-empt the offer of food by making arrangements to do something else.
Sometimes, you might find it difficult to refuse food because it can be hard
to say no, rather than because a family member is often offering food. You
might find that you aren’t always as skilled at saying ‘no’ to food as you are
at saying ‘yes’! The word ‘no’ might be one of the shortest in the dictionary,
yet it can also be the hardest. Here are some different phrases to try
* “It looks delicious but I just can’t manage any more.”
* “I literally just ate before I came over.”
You could also try experimenting with gently putting your hand up, palm facing
the person, in order to signal ‘no thank you’ non-verbally too. Smiling helps,
Remember, these ways of relating using food have been around for a long while.
You may need to ‘teach’ your loved one to behave in different ways around you
and food. It will take time to change habitual ways of doing things, but
developing these skills will help you to feel in control of your diabetes
management, health and weight, rather than the food.
