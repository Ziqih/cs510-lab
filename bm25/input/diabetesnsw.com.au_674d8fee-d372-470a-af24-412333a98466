hospitalisations but other cause hospitalisations has been examined in a
A US study of 6,718 adults concluded that the use of GLP-1 agonists together
with insulin resulted in a 1.7 per cent decrease in hypoglycaemia, a 1.97 per
cent decrease in pancreatic events, a 6.99 per cent decrease in all

A 2013 UK study (Yu) into the relationship between HbA1c and risk of all‐cause
hospital admissions among people with Type 2 diabetes showed that for every
11mol/mol (1%) above 61mol/mol (1.1%), hospitalisation rates increased by 6.3%
for all-cause admissions, 6.4% for diabetes admissions and 15.9% for
cardiovascular admissions. Enabling better management of HbA1c levels will
