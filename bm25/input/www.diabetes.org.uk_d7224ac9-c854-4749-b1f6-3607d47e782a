### Christmas is a time to enjoy yourself and have treats that you wouldn’t
regularly eat at other times of the year.
But being a time of indulgence and celebration, much traditional Christmas
fare tends to be higher in saturated fat, free sugars and salt than our usual

the festive season without compromising your diet or diabetes self-management.
Take a look at some of our favourite recipes, tips and handy advice:
To help manage diabetes at this time, try these tips to make your Christmas
* Fill up on the array of vegetables available, but watch out for added festive extras like honey.
* Keep an eye on your portion sizes, there’s likely to be an array of extra dishes so keep in mind how much you’re eating.
* If you’re having a dessert, try to stick to one portion of your sweet treat and think about what it’s served with, could you have natural yogurt instead of double cream for example?
* Remember there are no ‘forbidden’ foods, but go easy on the treats. Be mindful about what food you’re eating, but don’t beat yourself up if you do eat more than you usually would, or choose foods that aren’t as good for you.
* A slight break from the norm is to be expected - enjoy it, then get back on track the next day. Why not escape the hustle and bustle, or dodge the family row over the remote control on Boxing Day, and go for an exhilarating walk in the countryside?

yourself, drinking a little more mulled wine than you intended is a common
Regardless of whether you have diabetes or not, guidelines recommend that men
and women should not regularly consume more than 14 units a week and if you do
have as much as 14 units, spread this over three days or more.

## Eating out at Christmas when you have diabetes
Many restaurants offer set menus over the Christmas period. If you’re eating
out, see if the nutritional information is available online, so you can plan
ahead and pick a healthier option. Here are some more tips:
* Make sure you're the first to order, research shows you're more likely to be swayed by other people’s choices if you wait.
* If you have a smaller appetite, there's no reason why you can’t order a starter as a main meal especially if you know the restaurant serves large portions.
* Only order pudding after you’ve eaten your main meal, as you may find you're too full for one, or that now that you’ve eaten you feel less tempted to order one.
* Also, it’s always useful to follow the golden rule of filling most of your plate with tasty vegetables or salad – this can help you to feel full and provide helpful nutrients.
* Eat slowly and put your knife and fork down between mouthfuls. Research shows it takes about 20 minutes for your brain to register you are full and consequently people who hurry their meals are more likely to overeat.
* If your meal is delayed, and your blood glucose levels are in danger of going too low, ask if there is a bread roll to tide you over.
* Add extra vegetables to your plate. Research shows that the volume of food is important in helping us feel full and vegetables provide the bulk.
* Protein foods are filling – try to include a serving of lean meat, egg, fish or beans.
