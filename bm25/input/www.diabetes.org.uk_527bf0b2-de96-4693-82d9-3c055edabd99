### Fasting is an important spiritual aspect of many religions but it can lead
to major health problems for some people with diabetes. If you are showing any
symptom of COVID-19, it would be advisable not to fast. The Islamic month of
Ramadan is one of the longest periods of fasting. We have specific advice on
Anyone who is putting their health at serious risk by fasting is usually
exempt (doesn't have to take part). For example, you won't usually be expected
to fast if you treat your diabetes with insulin or have diabetes complications
such as damage to your eyes, kidneys or nerves in your hands and feet. Speak
to your healthcare team for advice if you aren't sure if you should fast and
Other exempt groups include children, the sick, the elderly and pregnant
As well as the abstinence from food (and sometimes drink), fasting is also
usually a time of prayer, reflection and purification. If you treat your
diabetes with certain medications such as insulin, there is also the danger of
the blood glucose levels becoming too low leading to a hypo or too high which
can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a condition requiring hospital
admission. The symptoms of DKA include feeling very thirsty and passing a lot

Depending on the religion, fasting will last for different lengths of time. In
Christianity, Hinduism and Judaism there tend to be individual days of
fasting. However, the Islamic month of Ramadan is one of the longest when it
is compulsory for all healthy Muslims to fast between the hours of sunrise and
## What happens to your body during fasting?
The changes that occur in the body during fasting depend on the length of the
continuous fast. Usually your body enters into a fasting state eight or so
hours after the last meal. Your body will initially use stored sources of
glucose and then later in the fast it will break down body fat to use as the
next source of energy. Using your body’s fat stores as an energy source can,
in the long run, lead to weight loss. Losing weight, particularly if you are
overweight, can also lead to better control of blood glucose, blood pressure
and cholesterol levels. However, fasting should not be used as a way of losing
During the fasting period, your eating pattern may be very different compared
to normal. However, it is important to keep to a balanced way of eating,
including food from all of the food groups and not to eat excessively.
If you have diabetes and are fasting, it is a good idea to include more slowly
absorbed foods (that have a lower glycaemic index) just before you begin the
Choosing these types foods will help to fill you up and keep your blood
glucose levels more even during the course of the fast. Fruits, vegetables and
When you break the fast, include only small quantities of sugary and fatty
foods such as Indian sweets, cakes, samosas and puris, as too many can make
you gain weight. Use less oil in cooking and try grilling, baking or dry
Additionally, drink plenty of sugar-free and decaffeinated drinks to avoid
dehydration, e.g. water, diet fizzy drinks or no-added sugar squashes. If you
like sweet drinks then use a sweetener instead of sugar.
If you decide to fast, it is important to test your blood glucose levels more
often as your blood glucose levels may drop too low (known as hypoglycaemia or
hypo), particularly if you are unwell and/or are treated with insulin or some
diabetes medications – speak to your diabetes team about this.
If you experience the symptoms of a hypo, eg feeling shaky, sweaty and
disorientated, you must break the fast immediately and treat it with your
usual hypo treatment, eg glucose tablets, a sugary drink or GlucoGel, followed
by a snack such as a sandwich or a bowl of cereal.
If you have to break your fast for any reason, continue your meals as normal
for that day.You may be able to make up the fast at a later date or provide
If you have Type 1 diabetes, there is also a danger that your blood glucose
levels may run too high (known as hyperglycaemia) and result in a build-up of
'ketones'. This could potentially result in a serious condition known as
ketoacidosis. The symptoms of high blood glucose levels might include feeling
very thirsty, passing a lot of urine and/or extreme tiredness. If your blood
glucose levels stay high and you experience these symptoms, speak to your
Before you begin fasting, your diabetes team can also advise you on what to do
with your medication and how to keep good diabetes control. For example, your
diabetes team may advise you to change the time, type or dose of medication to
ensure your blood glucose levels are well controlled.
