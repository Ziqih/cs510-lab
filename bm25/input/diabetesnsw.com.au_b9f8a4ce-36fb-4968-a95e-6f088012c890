# Study investigates how dietary fat can affect insulin dosing in t1
A new study by Australian and American researchers is investigating the
insulin dose adjustments needed for different fat content in food eaten by
people with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps.
People with type 1 are being advised to adjust insulin for dietary fat. It is
known that combining fat with carbohydrate at meals can slow how quickly food
is absorbed and this can affect the required timing and dose of insulin.
However, the optimal way of adjusting doses in response to differing levels of
fat in a meal has not been known.
The research involved participants having meals with 45g of carbohydrate and
with 0g, 20g, 40g or 60g of fat. The participants attended the research clinic
To control blood glucose levels, participants used their own insulin to
carbohydrate ratios and took a dual-wave bolus dose on their pumps, with the
amount of insulin split 50/50 between the two waves over hours.
A dual wave bolus involved an immediate initial bolus of insulin followed by a
second bolus delivered gradually over a set period of time.
The researchers found that the more fat the meals contained, the lower blood
glucose levels were in the first two hours of eating the meal and the higher
blood glucose levels were in two to five hours after eating.
In subsequent visits, participants repeated the meals, but a model was used to
predict the insulin dosing. The experiments to get the right doses were done
The findings of these further experiments allowed the researchers to see what
split of insulin dosing was needed to achieve good control.
The results showed that for the 20g of fat meal, a dual-wave bolus was
delivered over 73 minutes. This meal required 6% more insulin than the meal
without fat and the split of insulin across the two waves of the dual-wave
bolus was 74% of the dose for the first wave and 26% of the dose for the
For the 40g of fat meal, a dual-wave bolus was delivered over 75 minutes. This
meal also required 6% more insulin than the meal without fat and the split of
insulin across the dual-wave bolus was 63% of the dose on the first wave and
Finally, the 60g of fat meal required the dual-wave bolus to be delivered over
105 minutes. The meal required 21% more insulin than the meal without fat. The
split of insulin across the two waves of bolus were 49% of the dose for the
first wave and 51% for the second wave.
The results may help to inform future recommendations of insulin dose
As insulin dosing can vary significantly from one individual to another, it is
best to discuss insulin doses with your diabetes health team if you feel you
may benefit from a significant dose adjustment. Your diabetes health team can
help you to make dosing adjustments with the right precautions for safety.
