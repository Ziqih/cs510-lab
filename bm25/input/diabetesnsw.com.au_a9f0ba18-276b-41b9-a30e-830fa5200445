# Gut microbiome a predictor for type 2 diabetes
Researchers have found that the composition and function of bacteria in the
human intestine – the so-called gut microbiome – changes as the day
progresses. These changes may help predict type 2 diabetes.
In a study comprising more than 400 participants undertaken by the Technical
University of Munich (TUM) looking at the microbiome and diabetes, it was
found these daily variations cease to exist in people living with type 2
The microbial composition of the intestines is complex and varies widely from
one individual to another. Many factors such as environmental factors,
lifestyle, genetics or illnesses affect the intestinal ecosystem of helpful
Dirk Haller, Professor for Nutrition and Immunology at TUM, and his team have
examined the importance of daytime-dependent fluctuations of the gut
“In order to see whether changes in the gut microbiome allow conclusions about
medical conditions, so-called prospective cohort studies are required,”
In these prospective cohort studies, a cross section of the population is
being observed; however, none of the participants showed any signs of disease.
This population is being re-examined over time. This way, researchers can find
out whether a certain observation may be typical for future occurrences of

“When certain gut bacteria do not follow a day-night rhythm, that is, if their
number and function does not change over the course of the day, this can be an
Knowing this can improve diagnosis and outlook of type 2 diabetes,” said Dr.
These arrhythmic bacteria – those that are not changing between day and night
– are a marker for potential disease. Researchers refer to this as a risk
“Mathematical models also show that this microbial risk signature consisting
of arrhythmic bacteria helps diagnosing diabetes,” said Dr Kiessling.
Primarily, the scientists analyzed data from an existing independent cohort
from Munich. The diabetes-related results were validated using additional
cohorts from Germany. “By comparing our data to cohorts in England, we could
confirm that there is – among other things – a strong regional factor
affecting the microbial ecosystem. Therefore, there is a demand for finding
Dr Haller emphasizes that “apart from bacteria and their variations over the
course of the day, other parameters such as the body mass index play a role in
being able to better predict a person’s future medical conditions.”
Registering the time of day when taking human fecal samples for research
purposes can heavily influence disease diagnostics. “Documenting these
timestamps is essential for improving risk markers,” Prof. Haller emphasizes.
This research substantiates the hypothesis that changes in the microbiome have
an effect of nutrition-related diseases. How gut bacteria changing (or not
changing) during the day affect other microbiome-associated diseases such as
Crohn’s disease or intestinal cancer may be subject to further scientific
