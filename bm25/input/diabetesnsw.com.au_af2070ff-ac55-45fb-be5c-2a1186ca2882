wisdom, new research confirms it is better for people living with type 2
A world first study shows that people who go to bed early are more likely to
be in better health and more physically active compared to night owls.
The research conducted by the University of Leicester and the University of
South Australia, assessed the bedtime preferences (sleep chronotypes) of
people with type 2 diabetes, identifying a connection between bedtimes and

As the global prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity continue to rise,
finding ways to prevent these health issues is critical.

preference to go to be early and get up early, with an average bedtime of
22:52); 23 per cent had evening chronotypes (a preference to go to bed late
and get up late, with an average bedtime of 00:36); and 52 per cent said they
UniSA’s Dr Alex Rowlands says the study provides a unique insight into
“The links between sleep times and physical activity is clear: go to bed late
and you’re less likely to be active,” Dr Rowlands says.
“As sleep chronotypes are potentially modifiable, these findings provide an
opportunity to change your lifestyle for the better, simply by adjusting your
