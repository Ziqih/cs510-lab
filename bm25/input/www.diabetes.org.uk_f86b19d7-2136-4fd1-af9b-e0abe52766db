# Over £6.8 million committed to new research projects across UK in the last
In 2019, we committed over £6.8 million into over 35 new research projects all
across the UK. We’re supporting research to tackle the immune response in type
1 diabetes, understand how insulin release is controlled in type 2 diabetes,
and search for more ways to help reduce the risk of diabetes complications.
In 2015, Diabetes UK and JDRF came together to establish the Type 1
Immunotherapy Consortium, led by Professor Colin Dayan at Cardiff University.
Today, we have pledged just under £800,000 across two projects to further
These treatments hope to stop the immune attack behind type 1 diabetes from
happening. Our support will help to expand UK immunotherapy trials and find
better ways of measuring their success, so we can speed up progress and reach
the first immunotherapy for type 1 diabetes sooner.
Around 4 million people in the UK have type 2 diabetes, and by 2025 we believe
that number could reach 5 million. That’s why we’re supporting research that
will help to reduce the impact of type 2 diabetes, to help people live
At King’s College London, we’re supporting Professor Shanta Persaud, who wants
to see if a chemical released by the pancreas could help to boost insulin
production. She hopes this research could lead to new treatments for type 2
We’re also supporting research projects aiming to improve quality of life for
people with diabetes by tackling complications. Dr Judith Lechner at Queen’s
University Belfast is one of our latest RD Lawrence Fellows, who works on
finding ways to prevent retinopathy. She wants to examine if a protective
protein can be used to repair and reduce damage to the eyes, helping to
Dr Elizabeth Robertson is Director of Research at Diabetes UK. She said:

We’ve funded over £67 million worth of research in the last decade alone, and
we’re continuing to support innovative research across the UK. We've been
behind historic achievements, like funding the development of the first
insulin pen and handheld glucose meter. And we’ve also supported contemporary
breakthroughs, like the DiRECT trial, which showed remission of type 2 can be
a reality. Moving forward, we will continue to support researchers to find new
ways to care, cure and prevent diabetes of all types.
