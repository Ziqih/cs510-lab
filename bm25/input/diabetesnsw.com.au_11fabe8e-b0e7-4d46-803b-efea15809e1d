Ever thought ‘I don’t need to get the flu vaccine, I’m healthy’?
Unfortunately, it’s not that simple and good health isn’t enough to protect
you from the flu – though it certainly helps!
Here’s what you need to know before heading into the cooler months.
Influenza (or the flu) is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by
influenza viruses. The flu is around all year but is usually most active in
Influenza viruses are mainly spread by droplets made when a person coughs or
sneezes. Viruses can also be spread by touching surfaces where these droplets
have landed. This is why we cover our faces when we need to cough or sneeze.
##**Why is it important for people living with diabetes?**

Vaccination prevents people from becoming infected with diseases. A vaccine
inserts a small amount of inactivated disease enters your body and triggers
your body’s defence system to create antibodies. The antibodies remember what
the disease(s) look like and can kill this type of germ if you are exposed to
The flu vaccine reduces the risk of infection by 50-60% (range 38-96% in
recent Australian studies), though this varies yearly. Because the fly vaccine
doesn’t contain the whole virus it can’t give you the flu, and you can’t pass
The more people who are vaccinated, the less disease there is to circulate in
the community. This not only keeps more people healthy, vaccination also helps
protect those who are unable to have the vaccine (such as babies under the age
Everyone over the age of 6 months is recommended to get the flu vaccine
annually, particularly anyone who is at higher risk of disease (such as people
living with diabetes). This is because the virus strains used in flu vaccines
can change from year to year, depending on which viruses the World Health
Organisation predict to circulate that season. Therefore, last year’s vaccine
won’t protect you for this year’s flu virus.
The flu is vaccine is available for free to:
* All people aged 65 years and over
* All Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 6 months to 5 years
* All Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15 years and over
* People aged 6 months and over with medical conditions predisposing to sever influenza, including type 1 and type 2 diabetes
Pregnant women should be vaccinated at any time of the year and at any stage
of pregnancy. Pregnant women who are vaccinated also provide protection to
their newborn babies until they are six months old.
