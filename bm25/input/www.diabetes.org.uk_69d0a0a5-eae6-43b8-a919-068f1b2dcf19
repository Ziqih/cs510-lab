# Letting people know about your Type 1 diabetes
Many people find talking about a personal subject with other people
uncomfortable, apart from perhaps close friends and family.
A long-term health condition such as diabetes can feel very personal, and so
may pose a challenge when the need to inform others arises. For example, if
you're just starting your first job, you may not feel confident or secure in
talking about your diabetes to your new colleagues.
The Diabetes UK Young Leaders Action Group have developed a series of brief
Type 1 diabetes info sheets for for young people with diabetes who need to
inform those around them but may not know how.
* a concise and simple description of what diabetes is
* why other people should know about it
* how to identify the signs of a hypo
* why you may not realise you are having a hypo, and may not be able to help yourself
* how and what to treat to treat a hypo with
* what to do in case of an emergency.
Your colleague or friend can then keep the info sheet for future reference.
