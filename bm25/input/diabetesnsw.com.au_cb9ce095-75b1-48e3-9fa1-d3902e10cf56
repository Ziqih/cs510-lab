# Rotavirus may switch on type 1 diabetes
Researchers from the University of Melbourne are proposing that the rotavirus
infection could play a role in triggering the onset of type 1 diabetes.
Rotavirus is a highly infectious stomach bug and a major cause of
gastroenteritis, a condition that causes diarrhoea and vomiting.
Vaccination programs in Australia have significantly decreased mortality rates
as a result of rotavirus infection. While in the UK, the NHS reports that
vaccination against rotavirus prevented more than 70% of cases.
The research notes that there has been a 15% decrease in incidence of type 1
diabetes in children under the age of four following the introduction of the
Researcher Leonard Harrison, said: "Vaccination against rotavirus may have the
additional benefit in some children of being a primary prevention for type 1
The researchers reviewed molecular evidence which showed strong similarities
between the rotavirus and islet autoantibodies. The fact the rotavirus mimics
autoantibodies lends itself to the hypothesis that rotavirus could trigger
The Australian team also looked into other studies showing an associated
decrease in incidence of type 1 diabetes following rotavirus vaccination. In
one of the studies reviewed, there was a 41% decrease in type 1 diabetes
incidence among children that were fully vaccinated against rotavirus
infection. The data showed 12.2 cases of type 1 per 100,000 person years in
those that were vaccinated. This compared with 20.6 cases in those
The researchers are keen for further research to focus in on identifying which
children are most likely to be protected by rotavirus vaccination. The team is
also keen to see research identify whether rotavirus infects the human
