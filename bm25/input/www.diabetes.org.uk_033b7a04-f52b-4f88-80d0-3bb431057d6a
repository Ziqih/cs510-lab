# Medical alert: Batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill to be recalled

Penfill insulin because of a manufacturing problem during the filling of the
cartridges, which resulted in some batches of NovoMix 30 containing too high

percentage of cartridges (0.14%) contain a wrong amount. However, in the
affected cartridges the level of insulin may vary between 50% and 150% of the
labelled insulin units, which could lead to hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.

from the affected batches be switched to products from unaffected batches or,
if such batches are not available, to alternative treatment.

NovoMix 30 FlexPen or the NovoMix 30 Penfill to see if their medicine is
affected. If the batch number on their pen or cartridge does not correspond to

Simon O'Neill, Diabetes UK's Director of Health Intelligence and Professional
Liaison, said, "The important thing is that anyone affected by this must keep
taking their insulin but should get it replaced at the earliest opportunity.

that their glucose levels may potentially run higher or lower."
