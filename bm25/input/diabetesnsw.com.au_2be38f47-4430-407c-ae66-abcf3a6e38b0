* 1 small capsicum (red, orange or yellow), sliced into 1cm strips
* 1 x 5mm slice of cheddar cheese
1. To prepare the ingredients, trim the ends of the snow peas and cut the capsicum into long slices. Cut a 5mm slice off a block of cheese and use a small star cutter to cut out 4 star shapes.
2. Thread your capsicum and snow peas alternatively on to the skewer. Using a sharp knife, cut diagonally from the point of the skewer to the edge of the lowest capsicum/snow pea (whatever is at the base). Repeat on the other side to create a triangle shape. Carefully add your cheese star to the top.
3. Snip the sharp end of the skewer for safety and always supervise young children when serving food on skewers.
Replace the capsicum and snow peas with celery and carrots to add more
variety. Enjoy the vegetable Christimas trees with your favourite dips
(hummus, white bean pate, baba ganoush or tzatziki) for extra flavour and
