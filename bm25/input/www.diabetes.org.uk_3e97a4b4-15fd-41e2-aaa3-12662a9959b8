A noodle salad packed full of vegetables – great for a lunch on the go.
Please view Whisk.com privacy policy for more information
1. Cook noodles according to pack instructions (times vary – typically 4–6 minutes), drain and immediately plunge them into cold water to stop them cooking further. Drain again and then add to a bowl with the toasted sesame oil, mix well and reserve.
2. Meanwhile, add the rapeseed oil to a pan, then add the red pepper, ginger and chilli (if using), and stir for 2 minutes.
3. Next, add the spring onions and bean sprouts, toss for 1 minute and then remove from the heat.
4. Add the bean sprout mixture to the noodles, along with the coriander, cucumber, lime juice, and half the peanuts, and mix well.
5. Put into lunch boxes and sprinkle the rest of the peanuts on top, adding 1 tsp soy sauce to each, to flavour if desired.
* Choose reduced-salt soy sauce to lower the salt content in this recipe. Alternatively, to make the recipe healthier, leave out this ingredient altogether.
* Use rice noodles and gluten-free tamari, instead of soy sauce, if using, for a gluten-free salad.
* You could also try this recipe with a mix of walnuts, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds.
