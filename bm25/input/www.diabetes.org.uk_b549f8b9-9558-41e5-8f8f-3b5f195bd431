Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile
device when you visit a website or an app. Next time you visit that webpage or
app, your browser sends the file to the website's server. This means the
server will recognise as you as a previous visitor (although it won't know
your name) and will tell the website. There are many reasons as to why we use
cookies. For example to remember settings you used previously or to keep items

Other tools which are similar to cookies include web beacons, scripts, pixels,
clear gifs and tags. These use a small transparent image which is embedded in
an email or web page. When you view the page or email, a signal is sent which
confirms that you have accessed the content on that page or email. This allows
websites to understand how users navigate through the content on the website.
**Strictly necessary cookies** are cookies that are essential to make our site
**Performance cookies** are cookies which help us to monitor and optimise the
performance of our website. These tell us information like which pages are
most popular, how people navigate through our website, how many new users have
viewed a page etc. Sometimes we also use cookies to test different versions of
our web pages to see which ones work best. These collect aggregate information
about visitor numbers and don't identify you individually.
**Functionality cookies** are cookies which allow our website to remember the
choices you make (such as your user name, language, last action and search
preferences) and provide enhanced, more personal features. The information
collected by these cookies is anonymous and cannot track your browsing
**Targeting cookies** are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and
your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an
advertisement on our web site and help measure the effectiveness of the
advertising campaign. These may also be used to choose the advertisements that
are displayed to you on our web site and other websites.
**First party** cookies are set by the website you're visiting (i.e.
diabetes.org.uk) and only Diabetes UK can read them.
**Third party** cookies are not set by Diabetes UK and can be read by the
owner of those cookies. They may be created by tools that we use on our
website, such as when we embed a YouTube video, include a social media button
on our pages or embed a Google map. In most cases we can't control what
information they collect but we can tell you what cookies we use.
**Session cookies** are temporary cookies files that are erased when you close
your browser. They do things like remember what you put in your shopping
basket so it doesn't disappear when you navigate to another page.
**Persistent cookies** stay in one of your browser's subfolders until you
delete them manually or your browser deletes them based on the duration period
contained within the persistent cookie's file. These are used so you can be
recognised when you come back to a website, for example by remembering a log-
## Why we use cookies and other similar tools
Diabetes UK uses cookies and other similar files on its website in order to:
* Enhance your web experience, by optimising our site to meet your computer's browser and display settings.
* Allow us to use multimedia content on our site (e.g. Flash videos), via third-party cookies.
* Remember some of your choices – e.g. the items you put in the basket of our online shop, so you can access them later, or your preferences for using our website.
* Embed useful tools from third parties in our website, like maps, videos and social media sharing buttons
* To personalise your experience on your website by saving pages of interest, through our "Diabetes & Me" tool
* To find out if our emails have been read and if you find them useful
* To show you reminder advertisements on other platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Linked In when you leave our website and to monitor the success of our advertising on other platforms so we know if it's cost-effective.
* Provide us with aggregate analytical information about how people use our website, e.g. number of visits to a page.
* To build an audience of people who are similar to visitors to our site. This works by a cookie which recognises if visitors to a particular page of our web site are also Facebook users. Facebook then makes a list of Facebook users that visit that page and combines the information it already has about them (on an aggregate basis) to create a description of people who also might be interested in that particular pages of our site ( **an audience** ). For example, this might show that people who are interested in our swimming challenges tend to be interested in cats and are aged 35–50 on Facebook who haven't already been to our site (and who have agreed with Facebook that their data can be used for this). This helps us to find new potential supporters. If you aren't a Facebook user, Facebook won't include your information in the audience. While we don't use cookies to identify you when you visit our site, you should be aware that because social media sites and advertising companies use these technologies widely across the Internet, they can be used to build up a pattern of your browsing behaviour and to target advertising to you based on that information.
You can choose to block the targeting cookies we use on our website in our
Cookie Preference Centre. You might still see some adverts from us elsewhere
on the internet, but it won't be targeted at you. You can also tell us if you
don't want Facebook to use your data to create an audience through our
communications preference form. From their site, you can control third party
If you use social media, you can change your advertising preferences in your
account privacy settings. The Information Commissioner's Office has some handy
