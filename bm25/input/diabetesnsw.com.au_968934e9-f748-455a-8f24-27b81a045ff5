I grew up in Yorketown three hours’ drive from Adelaide. I was the youngest of
three children and was involved in music and community sports from a young
age. When I was 15, my music got me a scholarship to Immanuel College in
Adelaide but while there, my netball took over and in 2016 I was signed with
While I was playing with the Thunderbirds that a routine blood test came back
The doctor asked if I’d had something sweet to eat before the test, and
because I’d had a muesli bar she asked me to come back in for another test.
That one also came back quite high. So they gave me a monitor and I had to
start pricking my finger regularly so I could keep tabs on my glucose
I’d have to regularly check my glucose levels and once I wasn’t able to obtain
a reading under a certain level, it meant my body needed some extra help and I

monitoring of the team, I’d probably still be putting her body at risk with

with high blood glucose levels. I trialled a monitor on her arm for two weeks

My biggest challenge is trying to work out whether I’m having pre-game jitters
or whether my glucose is dropping and, during a game adrenalin makes my levels
rise, so I often have to adjust accordingly at half time.
Publicly disclosing my diabetes diagnosis was a decision I didn’t take lightly
but the feedback from the public has been amazing. I didn’t want any sympathy
but it’s just been really special. A whole different community have reached
2019 was definitely a big year for me. I went from a tough pre-season, to
playing for Australia at the World Cup, to winning the SSN championship with
the Swifts and beating the Ferns for the Constellation Cup, all while managing
my new diabetes diagnosis and completing my Masters of Occupational Therapy.
