# Obesity linked to different health risks for women and men
New research covering over 423,000 UK adults has revealed that the health
implications of obesity extend much further than diabetes and heart disease
extending to diseases of the kidneys, lungs and liver.
The study found that obese individuals are more likely to be affected by
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver diseases
and lung cancer – life-threatening conditions that the World Health
Organization has ranked among the leading causes of death and disability.
Dr Sanne Peters, Research Fellow in Epidemiology at The George Institute for
Global Health said, “Observational studies had already shown that obesity is
linked to many major health conditions, but we wanted to know whether being
obese is causally related to other significant non-communicable conditions.
With the prevalence of obesity rising rapidly around the world, this research
set out to explore how being obese might negatively impact future health
outcomes, and how these might differ between women and men.”
Globally, levels of obesity have tripled since 1975. Researchers from the
University of Oxford used three obesity traits: overall obesity (BMI of
>30kg/m2); fat distribution (determined by waist-to-hip ratio, WHR, or the so-
called ‘apple’ versus ‘pear’ shape); and WHR adjusted by BMI, to determine if
and how obesity impacts risk of disease and whether being female or male
They found that the disease risk associated with obesity is also different
between women and men. A higher BMI led to a greater risk of type 2 diabetes
in women than in men, whereas a higher WHR increased risks of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease more in men than in
Dr Jenny Censin, from the University of Oxford said: “These findings reveal
that obesity is associated with major diseases and causes of death, with
several of the relationships between obesity and causes of death being
different between women and men. As obesity is preventable, our findings are
of relevance to public health policy and practice, and suggests that these
should include sex-specific measures in wider preventative approaches.”
The study was funded by the British Heart Foundation and by the NIHR Oxford
