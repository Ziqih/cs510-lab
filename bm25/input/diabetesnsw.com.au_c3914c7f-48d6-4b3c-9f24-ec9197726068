Diabetic nephropathy refers to kidney disease that can occur in people with
diabetes. The kidneys help regulate the amount of fluids and salts in the
body, which helps control blood pressure and the release of different
hormones. Nephropathy is the term used when the kidneys start to suffer
damage. If left untreated it can lead to kidney failure.
Diabetic nephropathy develops slowly and occurs when the kidneys become leaky,
allowing albumin (a protein made by the liver) to pass into the urine. The
condition worsens as the level of albumin increases.
High blood pressure and high blood glucose levels increase the risk of kidney
damage. Both states harm the small blood vessels in the kidney (known as
microvascular disease). As a result the small blood vessels become leaky and

* For people with type 1 diabetes: Keep your blood glucose levels as close to 4-6mmol before meals /L and 4-6 mmol/L two hours after the start of a meal
* Exercise regularly – aim for 30 minutes most days of the week
