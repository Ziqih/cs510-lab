# New guidelines for Type 2 issued by the National Institute of Health and
New clinical guidance published today (December 2) by the National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) may be “putting unnecessary obstacles in
the way of people with Type 2 diabetes getting best care”, according to
Diabetes UK.Theguidance, designed to help healthcare professionals support
people with Type 2 diabetes and provide commissioners with a framework to
commission appropriate services, has finally been published after long delays.
This was because contributors, including Diabetes UK, argued that further
changes needed to be made to make the final guidelines more practical in line
While the charity is broadly supportive of the new guidelines, it is still
concerned that, even with solid evidence, NICE is still continuing to wait far
too long before making changes to the guidelines that could benefit patients.
The charity says the consequences may not be a problem for specialist
clinicians, because they tend to be up-to-date and change their practices
accordingly. Diabetes UK says the key issue is that the vast majority of
people with Type 2 diabetes will be seen by generalist clinicians who often
rely heavily on the guidelines, may not be up to speed with the application of
new evidence and may be reluctant to go beyond out-of-date existing
guidelines. The concern is that this could lead to many patients waiting
unnecessarily to get access to tried and tested newer therapies.
Diabetes UK is calling on NICE to put in place a regular review process that
looks at emerging evidence and fully incorporates these into existing
guidelines on an ongoing basis so patients are not left waiting five years or
more for an update. Although NICE has advised in the guidelines that it is
‘considering’ setting up a standing update committee to enable more rapid
updating of certain areas of diabetes guidelines, nothing has yet been
confirmed.Where the charity says the guidelines have made strides is in the
clear emphasis on encouraging healthcare professionals to individualise care
and to prioritise care planning. Diabetes UK is now calling on clinicians to
use information from the guidelines but also to apply their clinical judgement
in discussing all appropriate options for medication regimes, and to work
jointly with the person with diabetes when making decisions thereby treating
them as an individual to better meet their specific needs.
Another key recommendation in the guidance is for people with Type 2 diabetes
to be offered better access to education. Diabetes UK welcomes this
recommendation and has recently launched its ‘Taking Control’ campaign, which
calls for more people to get access to the education they need to better self-
manage their condition. To increase education uptake, it is essential that
CCGs have a plan in place to deliver more education services and increase
uptake by working in partnership with clinicians. It is also important that
healthcare professionals find out what quality diabetes education courses are
available in their area and discuss the benefits of an education course with
Chris Askew, Chief Executive of Diabetes UK, said: “There are many things we
welcome from these new guidelines but we are calling on NICE to commit to on-
going updates so that people with Type 2 diabetes can benefit from latest
advances in medication and diabetes care. Diabetes treatment is an ever-
changing field so it is important for recommendations to be updated regularly
to reflect new evidence. We urge NICE to go ahead and set up the proposed
standing committee to enable a far more rapid update of reputable diabetes
guidance. Up-to-date guidelines will enable generalist practitioners to
support people with diabetes to manage their condition far better, so they can
reduce their risk of developing devastating complications. We also encourage
CCGs and healthcare professionals to increase access to diabetes education and
appropriate blood glucose monitoring to help with self-management.”
