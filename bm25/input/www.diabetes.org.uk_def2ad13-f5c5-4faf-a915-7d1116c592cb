# Benefits of swimming when you have diabetes
### Swimming is a great form of exercise for everyone, especially if you are
living with any type of diabetes or at risk of developing type 2 or
Here we’ll take a look at some of the health benefits of swimming, and include
some advice for managing your diabetes when you start swimming.
There are so many benefits to swimming, including:
* helps to strengthen muscles and improve coordination
* better for painful or stiff joints than other types of exercise
* helps look after blood pressure and cholesterol – really important when you have diabetes
* helps to keep your heart healthy, even more important because having diabetes means you’re more at risk of heart problems
As we’ve mentioned, swimming isn’t just good for your physical health, but
lots of people find swimming great for their emotional health too. We know
diabetes can be overwhelming and stressful at times, and swimming can be a
great way to relax. Going for a gentle swim will release feel-good hormones
called endorphins, which will help lift your mood.
But if swimming isn’t right for you, we’ve got lots more information about how
being active in all sorts of ways can help you to manage your diabetes, help
to reduce your risk of complications, and live a healthy life.

Swimming is a fun and relaxing way to keep fit. You could even get a group of
friends together to swim, and motivate each other to keep going. But if you’re
new to swimming or haven’t swum in a while, it’s important to start slowly and
If you want to set yourself a goal to work towards, why don’t you register for
We understand that everyone manages their diabetes differently. And how
exercise affects your diabetes depends on the type of exercise you’re doing
Some people worry that swimming could lower blood sugar levels too much and
increase the risk of hypos. But swimming can affect blood sugar levels in
different ways, and for some people it might cause them to be higher than
Here we’ll explain what to think about if you’re planning on swimming and take
insulin, if you’re at risk of hypos, and how to look after your feet and eyes.
But remember you can always ask your healthcare team about how to manage your
diabetes before, during and after exercise to make sure you’re being safe.
If you use insulin to treat your diabetes, you may need to adjust the dose on
days when you go swimming. This could be the dose of your long-acting (basal)
or short-acting (bolus) insulin. Or the rate that you get insulin through your
This will be different for everyone, so it’s important to get advice from your
diabetes healthcare team. Checking your blood sugar levels regularly around
Insulin sensitivity is how well your body uses insulin to get your blood sugar
levels down. And this sensitivity can increase for several hours (up to 48
hours) after you’ve finished swimming, so again keep checking your blood
sugars as they may be lower than you expect.
Manufacturers will have information on whether diabetes tech like continuous
glucose monitors, flash glucose monitors and insulin pumps are water
resistant. Each model is different so it is best to check with the company.
And if you are using a pump, ask your healthcare team if it’s safe for you to
Speak to your healthcare team if you take medications that increase the chance
of hypos, like insulin and sulphonylureas . You may need to adjust the dose
when you do more exercise but always check with your healthcare team first
Keep hypo treatments and your glucose monitor close by. And it’s also a good
idea to let someone at the pool know you have diabetes, like the lifeguard.
## Looking after your feet and eyes when swimming
Having diabetes means you’re more at risk of developing complications. These
include problems with your feet and eyes, so when you start swimming pay close
Signs of a serious foot problem include changes in colour, feeling, and watch
out for blisters, cuts or ulcers. Wear flip flops in the shower and around the
pool to avoid verrucas or injuries to your feet. If you notice that anything
isn’t healing, contact your healthcare team for advice.
If you have eye problems, get advice about whether you are safe to dive. But
Eating a balanced, healthy diet will ensure your body has everything it needs
When we exercise, our muscles need carbohydrates for fuel. If you’re planning
to swim a longer distance (say, for over an hour) you may need to eat some
And you may be surprised to learn that you can sweat during swimming, so you
can still get dehydrated. Keep yourself well hydrated before, after and during
your swim by having a bottle of water by the side of the pool.
Leave at least 3 to 4 hours after eating your last meal and starting swimming.
You could have a snack 1 to 2 hours before swimming if needed, such as a
cereal bar, a piece of fruit or yogurt.
Some people with diabetes may need to eat something with carbs half an hour
before swimming, to help manage blood sugar levels. But whether you actually
need a snack or not can depend on how long you plan to swim for, how intense
your session will be and what’s happening with your blood sugar levels.
If you’re going to be swimming for under an hour you shouldn’t need to eat
anything. But if you’re at risk of hypos, a snack could help to avoid your
blood sugar from dropping too low while you are swimming.
For a longer, more intense session (over an hour), glucose sports drinks or
gels can give you carbs during your swim. But these will probably affect your
It will be tricky to eat proper food while in the pool, so you might find it
easier to get out and have a snack instead.
Try to eat some carbs and protein as soon as possible after completing your
swim. If you don’t fully replace what your body has used in your session, your
A balanced meal of wholegrain carbs, vegetables or salad, fish or chicken,
beans or pulses will give your body everything it needs after doing exercise.
It can be hard to know where to start if you’re a swimming beginner. We’ve got

healthcare team can help and how to set goals to aim for and keep you
