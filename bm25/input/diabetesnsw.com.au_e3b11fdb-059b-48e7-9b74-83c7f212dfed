‘Mood, Food, Move and Me’ is shorthand for the holistic approach Diabetes NSW
& ACT recommends for managing diabetes so you can live well.
Whatever your age, whatever type of diabetes you live with and whatever stage
it’s at, if you pay attention each day to your mood, the food you eat, how you
move and your medical condition, you will always be aware of the adjustments
you need to make to live well with diabetes.
Mood, Food, Move and Me are all connected – each one has a beneficial effect
It works something like this: moving and eating properly will help you to stay
in a buoyant mood. If you’re in a good mood you’ll feel more like moving and
eating well. That, in turn, will make you better equipped to keep up your
testing and medications, so that the challenges of life with diabetes are more

Try these three simple tips to get into a more positive frame of mind:
* When you feel stressed, take time to stop, breathe deeply and be mindful of what’s around you. What can you hear or see or smell?
* Listen out for birds singing, listen to a lovely piece of music, smell a flower or the fresh air or a piece of ripe fruit.
* Just close your eyes for a few minutes and think of something beautiful in nature or of someone you love, or a friend or pet who makes you smile.

Eating a good range and the right amounts of nutritious foods is a key part of
living well with diabetes. But getting your diet right can be a challenge.
There’s so much to think about: calorie and carb counting, portion control,
and balancing all the food groups on your plate.
Don’t feel pressured to get everything right straight away. Start with one
aspect of your diet and once you’ve mastered, that move onto something else.
To help you get started check out our factsheet Food choice for people with
diabetes, our hints for healthy cooking as well as our full range of delicious
* Try re-sizing the amount of protein you eat. The chances are you’re eating too much meat, so try to balance this with more colourful food on your plate, such as sweet potato, spinach, beetroot and salad. The more colours on your plate, the better.
* Add a small portion of wholemeal rice or pasta or the tasty nutty flavour of chickpeas.
* Substitute water for soft drink, or, as you reach for a second glass of wine, go for the sparkling mineral water instead.
You’ll find, when you get into the swing of it, that managing a healthy diet
isn’t as hard as you thought it would be – and healthy eating is great for the

Eating a healthy diet can help lift your mood, which makes it easier to do

Moving for at least 30 minutes a day makes a big difference to your health and
wellbeing. It also helps lift your mood. So try to make time for it and be a
conscious of moving a little more each day.
You don’t need to go to the gym or run a marathon, you just need to take a few
more steps and move a little bit more than you did yesterday.
* Why not break your 30 minutes of moving into three 10-minute sessions. You don’t even need to leave home. You could walk up and down the hallway or your driveway for 10 minutes, or walk from the front door to the gate and back half a dozen times.
* While you’re doing that, admire the trees and plants, listen to the birds and be mindful of your senses. Or think about how to make your next meal more colourful.
* To make movement more interesting, mix things up a bit. Try strengthening your muscles and bones by lifting a can of tomatoes or baked beans 10 times with each arm.
* Better still, find a buddy and get out together. Walk to the cafe for a coffee or cup of tea, sit up and down on a bench 10 times – a bus stop is perfect for this– or park your car a couple of streets away from the shopping centre and walk there.
Moving more will help you enjoy your food more, put you in a brighter mood and
make it easier to deal with your routine of medications and testing.
