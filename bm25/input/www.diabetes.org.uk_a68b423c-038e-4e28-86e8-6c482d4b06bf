>>>>>>> I knew about Diabetes UK and I followed them on Facebook. When I
signed up for Swim22, I joined a separate Facebook page for everyone taking
part. People post about how they’re doing, if they’re struggling. It’s a
really supportive place. You get regular emails, there are league tables and
there’s website to log your lengths. It felt like I was part of a community.
>>>>>>> ##Inspiring women and girls to make changes
>>>>>>> I wanted to get in touch with Diabetes UK because of my family’s
experiences with diabetes. I’m a life coach, I do motivational speaking, I
talk about why we need to have more women and girls on boards, to make
changes. I thought, ‘here’s something that’s so close to my heart. It’s a

To make a conscious decision today. Change your breakfast, cut your portion by
25%. Cut the sugar in your tea down gradually, until you’re taking none.
>>>>>>> On top of that, I want to show women, particularly black women, that
it’s time to kick arse and get on it. We need more women like me, of colour,
saying, ‘let’s climb Mount Everest. Let’s go zipwiring. Let’s not limit

But we need to be able to say, ‘I’ve tried that.’

community that ‘if it can happen to me, it can happen to you. Let’s make

>>>>>>>> I recently tried to watch a film on the Diabetes UK website about
hypos that didn't have audio description. I couldn’t get anything from it and
it made me worry that other things may have been overlooked.
>>>>>>> I got in touch with the charity to tell them that in this instance,
they’d got it very wrong. They listened to what I had to say and now I’m
delighted to have started volunteering with the online team to ensure that the
website is much more accessible for people with sight loss.
>>>>>>> Totally blind people like me use a screen reader, which is a piece of
software installed on a PC, tablet or smartphone, which reads out what's on
the screen. I'm unable to use a mouse and therefore rely totally on being able
to use the keyboard, to navigate around web pages, emails or Word or similar
>>>>>>> I’m a member of Diabetes UK. Instead of the printed members’ magazine
Balance, I get an audio version on CD which means I can listen to it at my
leisure. In the future, I'd love to be able to get a podcast version of it, as
this would allow me to browse through the magazine's contents much faster and

to do it themselves. Accessibility should be everyone’s responsibility and I
strongly feel that when it comes to making our world more accessible for all,
doing nothing is not an option. If there is one phrase or saying, which neatly
sums up my attitude to life, it would be: "Always choose courage over

>>>>>>> I think diabetes gets a bad press and because people can be judgmental
about it, it’s hard to raise money for.
>>>>>>> It’s important that we raise funds for technology, because it’s such a
help. I know Diabetes UK is trying to get the tech improved for everybody with
their Cheque for Tech campaign. My flash glucose monitor means that when I’m
out walking, I’m not having to stop and prick my finger and squeeze blood out.
I can just do it. We’re very lucky in this country to have the NHS and
