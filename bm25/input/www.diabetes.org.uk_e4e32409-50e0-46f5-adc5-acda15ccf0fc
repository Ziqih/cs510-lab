>>>>>>> #### Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes aged 11
>>>>>>>> If one of my friends got type 1 diabetes, I would tell them to go on
the trial. I would say live in hope.
>>>>>>> Sharon and Harj's 11 year old son Mahn was diagnosed with type 1
diabetes in May 2020. They were determined to get him onto a clinical trial
testing a new treatment called an immunotherapy, which hopes to slow the
>>>>>>> Mahn’s diagnosis was the worst day of my life. Because his dad has
type 1 he had that understanding of what it meant. I remember the first thing
he said to me in the hospital was “Am I going to have hypos like daddy?”. That
was his biggest fear. I was very emotional and really we were just in shock.
>>>>>>> I did ask then at the hospital whether there was any research he’d be
able to take part in, but they told us not to worry about that just now and to
concentrate on sorting out his blood sugars. But having type 1 diabetes
myself, I thought research and having the chance to access a new type of
treatment might help and would certainly be better than nothing.
>>>>>>> I searched on the internet and looked through hundreds of clinical
trials that came up. I was concentrating on phase 3 ones, and that’s how we
>>>>>>> What we didn’t know at the time was how tight the window is to get in
there for these immunotherapy trials - it’s only a few weeks from the point
you’re diagnosed. That’s because the treatment is trying to preserve beta
cells and they need to give it to you quickly, before too many cells get
destroyed by the immune system. We were already three weeks into Mahn’s
diagnosis at this point and I realised we had to act fast.

>>>>>>> ###A pioneering treatment to stop the immune attack
>>>>>>> We live in London and I contacted the hospital nearby where the trial
was meant to be happening, but because of coronavirus they hadn’t opened up
>>>>>>> They told me Sheffield would be the first trial site to open, so we
then just had to wait and see if that would happen in time. And I remember
counting down the days, because at this point we had three weeks left to get
into the trial before that window closed and it would have been too long since
>>>>>>> The biggest consideration for me was is it safe, are we taking a risk?
But the team I spoke to spent a long time talking us through the history of
this drug - Teplizumab - and the findings from past trials. And lots of
immunotherapy drugs have already been used for other conditions and have been
around for years, so safety wise we felt comfortable.
>>>>>>> It was two weeks later when we heard from Sheffield. They knew how
desperate we were and had pushed really hard to make everything happen in
time. We’re so grateful for everything the team there did. Mahn was patient
>>>>>>> We went up to Sheffield as a whole family with Mahn’s two older
brothers. For the first visit we had to stay up for 14 days because they gave
Mahn an infusion of the drug every day over that period.
>>>>>>> I know the treatment is trying to preserve beta cells and change the
immune system. And that I’m having tests over time to see how it has changed
>>>>>>> I went into the hospital everyday for two weeks. They put a drip in
one of my hands to give me the treatment and took bloods from the other hand.
So it was hard because I had bandaged hands, but in the end I know it’s for
>>>>>>> The research nurses and whole team were just fantastic, and it’s great
to be surrounded by experts in the field. They brought board games in and they
make it fun and enjoyable, as much as they can. There have been difficult
times, but Mahn’s doing really well and we’re always checking in with him and
>>>>>>> He was on little doses of insulin when he was first diagnosed and now
he’s not taking any. He’s come off insulin and we hope it stays like that.
Maybe it’s the drug working, maybe there are other reasons. He could be on the
placebo - we don’t know - but it has definitely been a really positive start
>>>>>>> Mahn didn’t like the needles and taking his insulin, so I said to him,
let’s do this trial and maybe it will help you. But even if it doesn’t it will
help other children in the future, so it will be easier for them.
>>>>>>> My hope is that the immunotherapy could help him to keep the beta
cells he has still got and that those cells will keep on providing him with
some insulin. That’ll make things so much easier for him day-to-day. He’s not
having the lows, he’s not having the highs and he’s living as close to a
>>>>>>> It’s the scientists and the doctors that are doing the clever stuff,
but we’re doing our bit and it just makes us all feel like we’re helping. We
know his brothers will also have a higher risk of type 1 diabetes because they
share genetics. So, if we can help find a cure or something that prevents it
that’s what we want for the future. And it’s research that will do that.
>>>>>>> We want more parents and more doctors to know about these
opportunities to take part in immunotherapy trials. As soon as a child’s
diagnosed, the parents should be given this option. And then you know what’s
available if you want to explore it more, and if you don’t, then that’s fine.
But the information should be given to you. It shouldn’t have been as hard as
it was for us to find out about these trials. It’s hope at the end of the day
and the more research they do, the better the outlook.
>>>>>>> If one of my friends got type 1 diabetes, I would tell them to go on
the trial. I would say live in hope.
>>>>>>>> The study Mahn took part in is looking for participants right now. If
you or your child have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the last six
weeks you may be able to take part. Find out more about the PROTECT study and
