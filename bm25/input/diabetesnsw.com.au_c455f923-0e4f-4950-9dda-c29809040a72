Scientists from CSIRO’s Synthetic Biology Future Science Platform have used
advanced biological and chemical engineering to create a simpler, cleaner and
more cost-effective process for manufacturing diabetes treatment D-fagomine.
Project lead Dr Colin Scott and his team expect that once trialled
commercially it could reduce the cost of producing the treatment.
Type 2 diabetes occurs as a consequence of the hormone insulin not being
produced in sufficient quantities to convert glucose from food into energy.
When this process is disrupted, blood glucose can rise to levels where poor
D-fagomine is a chemical compound that can do this job in insulin’s place by
Dr Scott’s team used a series of enzymes to convert the cheap and abundant
chemical glycerol into D-fagomine. The successful process was achieved by
assembling a series of enzymes, each one doing just one chemical conversion,
and passing the product onto the next enzyme in series.
The enzymes were arranged in compartments, with each compartment containing
enzymes for one chemical step. The compartments were then assembled in the
Understanding the design principles for these ‘nanomachines’ can help build
new advanced molecular assembly lines – potentially opening the door for
improvements in other technologies reliant on chemical reactions, such as the
production of other drug treatments, biodegradable plastics and biofuels and
