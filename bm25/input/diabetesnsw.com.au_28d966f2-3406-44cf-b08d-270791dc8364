1 bunch baby carrots (250g), trimmed and peeled
1 parsnip (200g), trimmed and peeled, cut into lengths
2 baby beetroot (250g), scrubbed, peeled and cut into wedges
4 lean beef fillet steaks, trimmed (165g approx each)
2. Place the vegetables in a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and spray with cooking oil. Bake for 20 minutes then add nuts and figs.
3. Continue cooking for 10 minutes until tender and golden. Remove from oven and keep warm.
4. Grill steaks on a stove top grill or pan fry until cooked to your liking.
5. Toss the warm vegetables with spinach leaves and vinegar. Serve with steak.
To remove the chestnuts from their skin, use a small sharp knife to carefully
cut an 'X' on the flat side of each nut. Steam over a pan of boiling water for
8 - 10 minutes or until the skin starts to open up around the 'X' and come
away from the flesh. Remove from the heat and plunge nuts into a bowl of iced
water, then drain. The skin can now be peeled off the flesh.
Alternatively, prepare the nuts as above but simmer in a pan of boiling water
