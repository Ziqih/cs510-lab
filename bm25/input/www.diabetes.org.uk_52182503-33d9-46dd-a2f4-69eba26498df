A healthy, satisfying breakfast can make a big difference. But some
traditional breakfast foods are packed with sugar and fats. We've come up with
some simple swaps and ideas for breakfasts for diabetes, so you can take
charge of your diabetes and start your day the right way.
Although the packaging may make some cereals - like granola and cereal
clusters - appear healthy, they are often full of added sugars (also known as
free sugars) and unhealthy fat. Some children's cereals also have a lot of
free sugar. Instead, why not switch to porridge? Porridge oats or the instant
variety are both fine - just avoid those with added free sugars like honey and
golden syrup. Wheat biscuits, shredded wheat or muesli (with no added sugar)
are also great alternatives. For sweetness, add chopped fruit.
When buying cereal, the best thing to do is look at the 'front of pack' label,
and try to go for cereal with as many green lights as possible. But also check
the ingredients list, some newer versions of granola simple have nuts added
in. A great source of unsaturated fat and fibre. Yogurt can be a tasty
alternative to cereal, but many yogurts are high in free sugar. So why not try
making your own flavoured yogurt? Buy unsweetened Greek or natural yogurt, or
fromage frais. You can add fresh fruit and a few nuts, or seeds for some extra
* Switch from white toast to wholegrain versions like seeded batch bread, multi-seed, granary, soya and linseed. These are better for your diabetes and digestive health. They're more filling, too.
* If you’re making rotis and chapattis, use wholewheat flour.
* Instead of jam try mashed banana. Other healthy choices are low-fat cheese, cottage cheese with a couple of fresh chopped dates, or nut butter (make sure the one you buy doesn't have any additions like sugar or palm oil) and chopped banana.
* Try to keep croissants, pastries and muffins as an occasional treat.
* Try to limit the amount of oil when cooking. Cook with unsaturated vegetable oils, such as sunflower, olive or rapeseed, instead of butter or ghee.
* Add extra fruit and veg to bump up your fibre intake wherever you can. Add berries, dried fruit or half a banana to your cereal, or grilled tomatoes to eggs on toast.
* When you have a bit of time to spare, try making this breakfast crostini. That way everyone can tuck in.
* Choose roasted mudhi or chuda (puffed rice) with vegetables, instead of chudha upma with oil.
* Try dry roasted methi paratha instead of aloo paratha.
* Try rice, besan or oat cheela with dry fried vegetables.

important nutrients, so make sure to check our recipes for inspiration and
ideas. You should be eating some food from the protein group as part of your
Although some people may have concerns about incorporating eggs into their
diet, research shows that the cholesterol in eggs does not significantly
affect the level of cholesterol in your blood.
We should all try and reduce our intake of red and processed meat, and instead
use oily fish such as heart-protecting salmon or kippers. They're delicious
served with scrambled egg, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms and wholegrain toast.
Or why not try veggie sausages (just check the salt content). It's OK to have
an occasional sausage or rasher of bacon, but try grilling instead of frying
You could also try topping wholegrain toast with scrambled egg or egg bhurji,
avocado, cottage cheese with edamame beans and tomatoes, or grilled tomatoes
Even pure fruit juices and smoothies contain free sugars, and it's easy to
consume a lot in one go. It's better to eat whole fruit and veg, but if you do
have a juice or smoothie, limit the portion to 150ml once a day and try making
If you're buying coffee on the go, be on the lookout for added syrups and
purees, which contain a lot of free sugars. If you're not sure, ask the server
to tell you what ingredients are used in your favourite drink.

If you read our rundown of breakfast cereal bars and biscuits, you'll see
cereal bars aren't always as healthy as they appear. For a better breakfast
