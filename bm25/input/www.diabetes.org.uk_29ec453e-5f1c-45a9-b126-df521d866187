>>>>>>>> I’m now the same weight as I was in my 20s or early 30s – I’ll never
forget the people who gave me the opportunity to do it.
>>>>>>> Edward has been retired for just over five years. He was diagnosed
with type 2 diabetes at the age of 55 when he was working for an oil company.
After four and a half years of living with type 2, his GP offered him the
DiRECT trial. About to become a first-time grandparent, Edward saw this as the
ideal opportunity to change his lifestyle for the better. Edward has now been

the weight loss he achieved on the trial, and now walks 100 miles a week.

>>>>>>> My GP diagnosed me with Type 2 diabetes nine years ago – just before
my 55th birthday. I was put on metformin almost straight away, as well as
medication for blood pressure and cholesterol. I was on medication for four
>>>>>>> My doctor gave me some ideas about diet and how that could perhaps
help me cut down on some of the medication. But I was well aware that a lot of
the problem was as a result of the job I had - it was quite a stressful one,
and I was having to fly a lot to Europe.
>>>>>>> I didn’t know a great deal about Type 2 diabetes at the time, although
my father was diagnosed with the condition in his early 70s. When that
happened, I did think that maybe it’s something I would have to deal with in
the future. And my doctor had told me that this could put me at higher risk of
developing the condition – because of the family link, as well as my lifestyle

>>>>>>> After four and half years, my doctor told me about a trial for Type 2
diabetes and asked if I’d be willing to take part in DiRECT. My life had
changed around that time – I’d been retired for just over a year. And I
thought I really needed to do something different. I realised that taking part
in this trial could lay the foundations for the lifestyle change I needed. My
doctor was very helpful and encouraged me to go on it.
>>>>>>> At the time, I was still managing my diabetes with medication, and I
also played golf. That had helped, but not to a great extent – my weight was
>>>>>>> I’d got my weight down to a better level, but golf wasn’t enough.
DiRECT was the right opportunity for me to set things in motion – to become
more active and to change my lifestyle for the better.
>>>>>>> I started on the trial nine months later in August 2015. When I
started it, the DiRECT team leader, along with my doctor, stopped all of my
medication. And I’ve never had any since then. That was the biggest goal for
me – to see if I could control my Type 2 diabetes with diet.
>>>>>>> The difficult part of being on the trial for me was during the diet
replacement, having just shakes and soups, when some parts of my body were
changing very fast. In November 2015, I’d lost just over 2st 5lb (about 15kg)
and I looked a bit ill, so I checked with the team leader that everything was
>>>>>>> It all turned out fine – I was doing well. It was just that my body
had started to lose weight very rapidly. But I knew this part of the programme
was still healthy for me, even though to look at me, it didn’t seem that way.
But I didn’t for one minute think that I needed to stop. I had total trust in

>>>>>>> I knew that I had the self-motivation to make change happen, but going
on the trial gave me that kickstart I needed. I was also going to become a
grandfather for the first time and that was also a big motivation.
>>>>>>> When I was on DiRECT, I received a lot of support from the trial team
– really a lot. My practice nurse was lovely, as well as the leader of the
trial team. My wife, daughter and son, as well as my golf colleagues, gave me

lives. My wife also went on a low-calorie diet and over the course of a year,
>>>>>>> A lot of my friends were saying that I’d lose the weight, but then
would put it all back on, plus more. But they now look at me and they can’t
remember what I was like then – at the start of the trial. They now see that
this definitely works – weight wise and medication wise.
>>>>>>> For me, the biggest goal was to come off medication. And I’m now the
same weight as I was in my 20s or early 30s. I’ll never forget the people who
>>>>>>> Diet wise, my lifestyle has changed dramatically. And I now walk about
100 miles a week which includes three games of golf. I use a Fitbit app on my
phone to record distance and activity. I tried running, but my knees couldn’t
>>>>>>> My weight last year remained at 13st 2lb. One of the lessons I’ve
learnt from the trial team was to measure and weigh myself frequently, and
celebrate if it’s good and do something about it if it’s bad.
>>>>>>> I keep a daily diary and log my weight and activity. It keeps me

to think what would have happened had I not taken this opportunity. I don’t
think I would have been in the condition I’m now in – so, for me, it’s been
>>>>>>> In fact, I received a great deal of support all round, and that
support became stronger when everyone started seeing a change in my body
weight, which – in turn – started making them look at themselves and say, ‘If
he could do it, we could do it’.
>>>>>>> When the trial team told me I had put my Type 2 into remission, I felt
fantastic and it gave me that drive to make sure I maintained it.
>My HbA1c was 49mmol/mol, with diabetes medication, when I went on DiRECT.
> Since then, over the past three years, my HbA1c is either 34mmol/mol or
>>>>>>> I found that my lifestyle changed when the DiRECT trial started. After
dieting, things I used to eat in the past, I no longer ate. Everything now is
cooked from scratch and I follow some of the philosophy behind the programme –
looking at the amount of carbohydrates and fats I should be having. I’m
checking that more and more now, and it’s something that I plan to continue
doing. My weight has now stayed stable helped by the amount of walking I do.
>>>>>>> Bringing my blood pressure down through the trial means that I now
have more energy – I no longer feel exhausted and I can do more, too.
