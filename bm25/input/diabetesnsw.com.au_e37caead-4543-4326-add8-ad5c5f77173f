When it comes to weight loss, diet and exercise are usually thought of as the
However, sleep is an often-neglected lifestyle factor that also plays an
The recommended sleep duration for adults is seven to nine hours a night, but
many people often sleep for less than this.
Research has shown that sleeping less than the recommended amount is linked to
having greater body fat, increased risk of obesity, and can also influence how
easily you lose weight on a calorie-controlled diet.
Typically, the goal for weight loss is usually to decrease body fat while
Not obtaining the correct amount of sleep can determine how much fat is lost
as well as how much muscle mass you retain while on a calorie restricted diet.
One study found that sleeping 5.5 hours each night over a two-week period
while on a calorie-restricted diet resulted in less fat loss when compared to
sleeping 8.5 hours each night. But it also resulted a greater loss of fat-free
Another study has shown similar results over an eight-week period when sleep
was reduced by only one hour each night for five nights of the week.
These results showed that even catch-up sleep at the weekend may not be enough
to reverse the negative effects of sleep deprivation while on a calorie-
There are several reasons why shorter sleep may be associated with higher body
weight and affect weight loss. These include changes in metabolism, appetite
Sleep influences two important appetite hormones in our body – leptin and
ghrelin. Leptin is a hormone that decreases appetite, so when leptin levels
On the other hand, ghrelin is a hormone that can stimulate appetite, and is
often referred to as the “hunger hormone” because it’s thought to be
One study found that sleep restriction increases levels of ghrelin and
Another study, which included a sample of 1,024 adults, also found that short
sleep was associated with higher levels of ghrelin and lower levels of leptin.
This combination could increase a person’s appetite, making calorie-
restriction more difficult to adhere to, and may make a person more likely to
Consequently, increased food intake due to changes in appetite hormones may
This means that, in the long term, sleep deprivation may lead to weight gain
due to these changes in appetite. So getting a good night’s sleep should be
Along with changes in appetite hormones, reduced sleep has also been shown to
impact on food selection and the way the brain perceives food.
Researchers have found that the areas of the brain responsible for reward are
more active in response to food after sleep loss (six nights of only four
hours’ sleep) when compared to people who had good sleep (six nights of nine
This could possibly explain why sleep-deprived people snack more often and
tend to choose carbohydrate-rich foods and sweet-tasting snacks, compared to
Sleep duration also influences metabolism, particularly blood glucose (sugar)
metabolism. When food is eaten, our bodies release insulin, a hormone that
helps to process the glucose in our blood.
However, sleep loss can impair our bodies’ response to insulin, reducing its
We may be able to recover from the occasional night of sleep loss, but in the
long term this could lead to health conditions such as obesity and type 2
Our own research has shown that a single night of sleep restriction (only four
hours’ sleep) is enough to impair the insulin response to glucose intake in
Given that sleep-deprived people already tend to choose foods high in glucose
due to increased appetite and reward-seeking behavior, the impaired ability to
An excess of glucose (both from increased intake and a reduced ability to
uptake into the tissues) could be converted to fatty acids and stored as fat.
Collectively, this can accumulate over the long term, leading to weight gain.
However, physical activity may show promise as a countermeasure against the
Exercise has a positive impact on appetite, by reducing ghrelin levels and
increasing levels of peptide YY, a hormone that is released from the gut, and
is associated with the feeling of being satisfied and full.
After exercise, people tend to eat less, particularly when the energy expended
by exercise is taken into account. However, it’s unknown if this still remains
Research has also shown that exercise training may protect against the
metabolic impairments that result from a lack of sleep, by improving the
body’s response to insulin, leading to improved glucose control.
We have also shown the potential benefits of just a single session of exercise
While this shows promise, studies are yet to determine the role of long-term
It’s clear that sleep is important for losing weight. A lack of sleep can
increase appetite by changing hormones, makes us more likely to eat unhealthy
foods, and influences how body fat is lost while counting our calories.
Sleep should therefore be considered as an essential alongside diet and
physical activity as part of a healthy lifestyle.
