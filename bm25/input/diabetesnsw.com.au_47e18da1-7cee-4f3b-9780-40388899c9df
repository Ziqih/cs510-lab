* Type 2 diabetes and me – online course
I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in August 2012 at the age of 14. When I
was diagnosed I was extremely shocked, scared and overwhelmed with the thought

While in hospital I started to feel a lot more comfortable and safe because
there were nurses with me all the time – when I came home it was strange and
upsetting returning to my normal life. I felt like a completely different
person with boundaries and rules I had to follow.
Although it was a lot of responsibility, my parents were a great support. I
know at times you can feel lonely and as though there is no one else like you.
I have learned that you need to speak up about your condition and prioritise
your needs or people will not be able to help you.
Life is different now – I have had to do things I never thought I could do
before and I no longer feel intimidated and scared of the illness, I am in

I’m currently completing year 12 and have a part time job and I’m managing my
diabetes well. Diabetes NSW has helped me improve my knowledge and introduced
me to other people living with diabetes who inspire me to achieve all my goals
and work towards having the best control over my health.
