# Discovery may help slow diabetic kidney disease
Researchers from Monash University’s Central Clinical School have found that a
drug, already tested on other inflammatory diseases can decrease kidney injury
Led by Associate Professor Melinda Coughlan from the Department of Diabetes,
the five-year study initially discovered that a key immune system pathway,
called the complement pathway – which usually protects the body from infection
– was hyperactivated and caused inflammation in people with diabetic kidney
Associate Professor Coughlan’s team then discovered this pathway could be
disrupted with a drug developed by Associate Professor Trent Woodruff, from
the School of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Queensland.
Through collaborative tests on mice with diabetes and in human kidney cells,
they could see that the drug helped to support the normal function of the
mitochondria within the kidney – known as the “batteries of the cell” – which
Associate Professor Coughlan said their discovery, published in the US journal
Diabetes on Friday (October 18), could potentially lead to a therapy to delay
or prevent renal failure in people with diabetic kidney disease.
“We’re saying this is a new link between the immune system and the
mitochondria, which could also help patients with diabetic kidney disease by
boosting mitochondrial health – so it could protect the kidney in patients
Diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic conditions in Australia. 298
people are diagnosed with diabetes every day, with one in four adults living
with diabetes or pre-diabetes. The condition is estimated to cost the economy
Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in working adults, and can cause
stroke, heart disease, limb amputations, and is the leading cause of renal
Associate Professor Coughlan said while the discovery wasn’t a cure or
prevention for diabetes, it could have enormous health and financial benefits.
“Findings like this will become important for managing the health of people
with diabetes. The economic burden of diabetes is huge, and this could
Associate Professor Coughlan, whose work includes investigating dietary
factors leading to the onset of diabetes and its complications, said they
would now look at developing medicines that target this pathway for future use
