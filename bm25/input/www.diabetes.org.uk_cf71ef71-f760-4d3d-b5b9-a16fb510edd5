# NHS spending on diabetes 'to reach £16.9 billion by 2035'
A new report published in the journal Diabetic Medicine has projected that the
NHS’s annual spending on diabetes in the UK will increase from £9.8 billion to
£16.9 billion over the next 25 years, a rise that means the NHS would be
spending 17% of its entire budget on the condition.
The Impact Diabetes report also suggests that the cost of treating diabetes
complications is expected to almost double from the current total of £7.7
Authored by the York Health Economic Consortium and developed in partnership
between Diabetes UK, JDRF and Sanofi Diabetes, the report highlights the large
percentage (79%) of NHS diabetes spending that goes on complications – many of
which are preventable. Investing in the checks and services that help people
manage the condition and thereby reduce the risk of complications could
actually be less expensive than the current approach.
The report quantifies the current costs of direct patient care for diabetes
(which includes treatment, intervention and complications) and indirect costs
of diabetes, such as those related to increased death and illness, work loss
and the need for informal care, and also predicts the UK’s future costs of
diabetes. According to the report, the total cost associated with diabetes in
the UK currently stands at £23.7 billion and is predicted to rise to £39.8
Barbara Young, Chief Executive of Diabetes UK, said, "This report shows that
without urgent action, the already huge sums of money being spent on treating
diabetes will rise to unsustainable levels that threaten to bankrupt the NHS.
But the most shocking part of this report is the finding that almost four
fifths of NHS diabetes spending goes on treating complications that in many
"The failure to do more to prevent these complications is both a tragedy for
the people involved and a damning indictment of the failure to implement the
clear and recommended solutions. Unless the Government and the NHS start to
show real leadership on this issue, this unfolding public health disaster will
There are currently around 3.8 million people living with diabetes in the UK
and, by 2035/6, this is expected to increase to 6.25 million.
* The current cost of direct patient care (which includes treatment, intervention and complications) for those living with diabetes is estimated at £9.8 billion
* £1 billion for Type 1 diabetes and £8.8 billion for Type 2 diabetes
* The current indirect costs associated with diabetes, such as those related to increased death and illness, work loss and the need for informal care, are estimated at £13.9 billion
* £0.9 billion for Type 1 diabetes and £13 billion for Type 2 diabetes
* Deaths from diabetes in 2010/11 resulted in over 325,000 lost working years
In addition to the above costs, it is estimated that there are 850,000 people
in the UK who have diabetes but have not been diagnosed and, according to the
study authors, the cost of undiagnosed diabetes can be estimated at an
* By 2035/6, the cost of direct care for patients will rise to £16.9 billion
* £1.8 billion for Type 1 diabetes and £15.1 billion for Type 2 diabetes
* By 2035/6, indirect costs associated with diabetes will increase to approximately £22.9 billion
* £2.4 billion for Type 1 diabetes and £20.5 billion for Type 2 diabetes
The JDRF welcomed the report for separately listing the costs of Type 1
diabetes, as the causes of Type 1 and the challenges it presents are very
different to Type 2. They called for further medical research to relieve the
vast economic impact on families, the NHS and the economy.
Sanofi Diabetes are planning to carry out further research examining the cost
impact of adopting NICE guidelines across the UK, intended to highlight how
investment in effective management could potentially reduce the overall cost
