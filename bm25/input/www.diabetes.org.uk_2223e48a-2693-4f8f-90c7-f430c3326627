>>>>>>> Pauline was initially misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which lead to
being admitted to hospital with dangerously high blood sugars. Now working at
Diabetes UK as a Senior Membership Manager, Pauline shares her journey to a
type 1 diagnosis and how she uses diabetes tech to help manage her condition.

>>>>>>> Pauline has had type 1 diabetes for over 10 years. At first, she
feared she was going to have to stop drinking alcohol or treating herself to
the occasional cake. But in this episode she shares how being properly
informed - and using the latest diabetes tech - helps her enjoy what she eats
without spending too much time on the detail.

>>>>>>> Back in 2010, just before my 40th birthday, a routine blood test
showed I had high blood glucose levels. My GP asked me to change my diet and
to take up more exercise. I was a little overweight at that time, but didn’t
think much of it. I went back to the GP after three months and I had lost a
bit of weight. The bloods were taken again and showed no improvement in my
HbA1c. It was then that my doctor told me I had type 2 diabetes. I was
shocked. How could this have happened to me? I was put on metformin and I saw
a dietitian and off I went and tried to come to terms with the diagnosis and
what that was going to mean for me.
>>>>>>> Things went well initially but the next year, I had been on holiday in
Florida and when I came home I felt really sick. I had been bitten by an
insect and the bite had left a mark about the size of saucer, which I knew
wasn’t right. I went to a walk-in centre near work, told them what had
happened and said I had diabetes. The nurse tested my blood glucose and it was
so high the meter couldn’t read it. She said I had to go to A&E straight away.
>>>>>>> After arriving at A&E I was admitted to hospital where I stayed for
four days until they could bring my blood glucose in to range. Thankfully I
went in before DKA had set in. The consultant who saw me on the ward told me
that my diagnosis was now type 1 diabetes. This was an even bigger shock than
the original diagnosis. Now I was going to have to inject multiple times each
day. It hit me like a freight train and I was really scared. When I went home
and did my first injection, there were tears.

>>>>>>> Soon after my stay in hospital, I looked up the Diabetes UK website as
I wanted to get as much information as I could about my condition. I became a
member, and bought books from the online shop. I also joined the online forum,
which was such a help in those first days not knowing what to do. I was having
issues with my GP who didn’t want to change my diagnosis on my records and I
wanted to be seen by a consultant at hospital, so I called the Diabetes UK
Helpline, who advised me how to get my care transferred to hospital. That call
was one of the best things I did, I managed to get my care transferred, and
>>>>>>> My team at the hospital are great, they got me on an education course
for people who are newly diagnosed with type 1 about six months after my
diagnosis, which was so helpful in coming to terms with my condition. I
learned invaluable tools, like what to do when you are sick and I also met up
with other people living with type 1. I knew I wasn’t alone. It was great at
lunchtime as we’d all pull our meters out and test before eating! I’m still in
touch with some of the people I met now and we catch up about our diabetes.
>>>>>>> I knew I wanted to use an insulin pump and my team were all for it. I
got my pump about 18 months after diagnosis. The pump has been a godsend to
me, I know it’s not for everyone but I find it so helpful and don’t mind being
attached to it at all. Last year my consultant approved me for a flash glucose
monitor (Libre) trial and I now have that on prescription too. I feel very
fortunate to have such a great team looking after me.
>>>>>>> I got my pump about 18 months after diagnosis and it's been a godsend
>>>>>>> The past ten years haven’t all been plain sailing. There have been
times, when having this condition has been tough. There are times when I want
a day off from the checking of numbers, calculating the carbs in my meals.
Mentally it’s hard. Physically it’s hard too, hypos can leave me feeling shaky
for hours. Constant worrying about my health is draining. But I carry on, as
we all do. I’ve had to come to terms with living with a long-term health
condition, it’s not easy, but some days are better than others. You have to

>>>>>>> When I arrived home from hospital I was worried about how much insulin
I was going to need to take. It was all trial and error to start with. I had
my first hypo alone, and that was scary. I called my husband who came home
from work to be with me, and throughout my ongoing journey with diabetes he
has been so supportive. I started carb counting initially through advice from
the online forum. It’s trial and error in the beginning, especially when I was
using pens as you can’t do very small doses like you can with a pump. I think
carb counting has been one of the most beneficial things for managing my
diabetes along with managing my insulin to cover food before eating.
>>>>>>> The best source of information for me in the early days were the books
I purchased from the Diabetes UK online shop, I’m a keen reader anyway and I
wanted to take in as much information about the condition as I could.
Forewarned is forearmed as they say. I’ve tried to be proactive in managing my
diabetes, I try not to let it control me and one way for me to combat that was
engaging with people online, I use Twitter and have a group of friends there I
can chat with about diabetes that’s been so helpful for me. I also went to a
local group although found the focus to be a bit on the type 2 side.

>>>>>>> In 2018 I started a master’s degree in History of Science and Medicine
that I did part time while working. I wrote my dissertation on diabetes in the
post-insulin era, something I probably wouldn’t have considered doing had I
not been diagnosed with the condition myself. I’ve been working as a
fundraiser for Diabetes UK since 2014, and took over managing the membership
team in 2018. I love my job, being able to raise funds for Diabetes UK gives
me a great sense of satisfaction. Knowing that all of our dedicated supporters
and members are helping us to achieve our mission and assisting with our vital
research in to all types of diabetes, gives me hope for the future, for all of
us out there living with this condition, that we may finally find a cure.
