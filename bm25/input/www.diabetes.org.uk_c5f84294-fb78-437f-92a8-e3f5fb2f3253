>>>>>>> The South London Diabetes and Ethnicity Phenotyping Study
>>>>>>> Dr Louise Goff and her team will compare sensitivity to insulin among
people of Black African and White European origin at different stages of Type
>>>>>>> They aim to improve our understanding of the exact causes of Type 2
diabetes in these ethnic groups and enable the use of more tailored strategies
>>>>>>> People of Black African origin are up to three times more likely to
develop Type 2 diabetes than people of White European origin. In addition,
some of the features of Type 2 diabetes differ slightly in people of Black
African origin. For example, cases of Type 2 in this ethnic group are less
closely linked to levels of fat around the waist and high blood cholesterol
levels than in people of White European origin.
>>>>>>> As a result, one-size-fits-all strategies to prevent or control the
development of Type 2 diabetes can be less effective in UK Black African
>>>>>>> This study will help to improve our understanding of the exact causes
of Type 2 diabetes in people of Black African and White European origin. Dr
Louise Goff and her team will compare sensitivity to insulin among people of
Black African and White European origin at different stages of Type 2 diabetes
>>>>>>> Specifically, they will measure how much insulin is needed to manage
fixed doses of glucose in people with ideal glucose tolerance and in people at
high risk of diabetes from both ethnic groups. They will compare each
individual's ability to produce insulin in response to glucose, and their
metabolism of glucose and fat in liver, muscle and fatty tissue.
>>>>>>> ### Potential benefit to people with diabetes
>>>>>>> Knowledge gained from this study will help scientists to develop more
effective strategies for Type 2 diabetes prevention and early treatment,
tailoring them to suit individuals from different ethnic groups and helping to
benefit those most at risk, particularly in Black African communities.
>>>>>>> This should help to improve early diabetes control, reduce the
incidence of diabetes and inform the development of new drugs.
