>>>>>>> When Kathleen, 66, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, she didn't show
any signs of having the condition, but already had high blood pressure and
high cholesterol. Her GP suggested taking part in our DiRECT trial. During 12
weeks of the programme she lost 13kg (around 2 stone). She's healthier and
fitter than ever and is now in remission.
>>>>>>> * Now 66, Kathleen from Prudhoe, near Newcastle, was
>>>>>>> * When Kathleen was diagnosed she didn’t have any of the
symptoms of Type 2 diabetes, and knew very little about the condition. Her
doctor was concerned, because she already had high blood pressure and high
cholesterol. In December 2015, she was offered the opportunity to take part in
>>>>>>> * She received a lot of support from her family and the
healthcare team looking after her during the trial.
>>>>>>> * Over the course of 12 weeks taking part in the weight
management programme, Kathleen lost around 13kg (around 2 stone) in weight ,
and was told her Type 2 diabetes was in remission.
>>>>>>> * Having taken part in DiRECT, she now knows more about
portion sizes, and has been able to keep her Type 2 diabetes in remission for

>>>>>>> You can reverse it, and I’m living proof of that. Grasp it, and go for
it, not only for yourself, for your family and grandchildren.
>>>>>>> I had type 2 diabetes for over one year before I started DiRECT. I
actually didn’t have any symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. I assumed that if you
had type 2 diabetes you would have a lot of symptoms, and I know a lot of
>>>>>>> I was bigger than I am now I’ve taken part in DiRECT, but I still
thought you had to be really large to have type 2 diabetes, which I’ve learned
since then that you don’t have to be. You can have diabetes at any size.
>>>>>>> When I got the letter to start on the trial, I wasn’t quite sure
whether I wanted to do it at first. I was trying to lose weight myself because
it had been creeping on, but it wasn’t working. My problem was portions - I
was cooking big portions. So in the end I decided DiRECT was tailor made for
me – I could lose weight, with the help of the doctors and nurses.
>>>>>>> I went along, and the nurse was really lovely. They send you for
scans, and that was the beginning of it. We see what people look on the
outside, but we don’t see ourselves on the inside. And I did. I saw all the
fat around my liver and pancreas. I was quite shocked. That was the point that
I thought, ‘I’ve got to do something about this, this isn’t healthy’.
>>>>>>> The trial is a bit of a shock to the system. Sometimes you feel down
and get a bit fed up with being on it, and you might drop out for a couple of
days, especially when you’re on the soups and shakes. Those hiccups happen to
everyone. Just focus, and a couple of days later, start again. We had charts
where they plotted the weight. The odd week where I’d put weight on, it made
me more determined to be good the following week.
>>>>>>> I cook all the meals for my husband, Dave. It’s always been that way.
I still cooked all the meals for him as I really enjoy cooking, I just made
sure I’d had my shake before cooking so I didn’t feel hungry. In the end, I
was on the soups and shakes for 12 weeks. I started adding more flavours to
them to make them more interesting, like herbs and spices or coffee.
>>>>>>> I’m also quite a social person, so it was difficult during the trial
because of the lack of meals, but I dealt with it. My friends were actually
asking me if I was ok, because I had lost a lot of weight. They thought I must
have been ill, but actually I was feeling better than ever!
>>>>>>> Weight loss can put Type 2 diabetes into remission for at least two
>>>>>>> We don’t see ourselves on the inside. And I did. I was quite shocked.
That was when I thought, I’ve got to do something about this, this isn’t
>>>>>>> My husband was very supportive of the trial. Even he lost a lot of
weight. My daughter was inspired by the changes in my body, and she also
started losing weight. They were both very happy for me. It makes it
worthwhile to do it when you can see all the dedication the nurses and the
doctors have been putting in to the trial. I did it for myself, but actually
>>>>>>> In life, you get out what you put in. And I did put a lot of effort
in, but it’s certainly been worth it, and the support I had was tremendous.
I’m so pleased to have taken part. Everyone’s been so helpful and I’ve gained
>>>>>>> When I was told I was in remission, it was brilliant. I felt I’d
achieved what I set out to do. I thought, it’s all been worth it, going to the
hospital, having all the blood taken and doing all the tests. When they showed
me the scan of the liver and the difference in fat, I was elated. Ironically,
I wasn’t bothered about changes on the outside, but the inside – the fat
>>>>>>> I’m aware that I’ve got to watch what I eat, but in general, I just
eat healthily. We’ve got two allotments, so we eat lots and lots of
vegetables. Dave grows them, and I cook them.
>>>>>>> Where would I have been now if I hadn’t have done it? I consider
myself very fortunate to have been on **the DiRECT trial. **
