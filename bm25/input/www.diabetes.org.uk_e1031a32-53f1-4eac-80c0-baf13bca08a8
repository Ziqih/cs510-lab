# Five million people at high risk of Type 2 diabetes
Five million people in England have blood glucose (blood sugar) levels
indicating a high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, according to a new
report published today by Public Health England (PHE).
The report, compiled by PHE’s National Cardiovascular Health Intelligence
Network (NCVIN), provides the most accurate and robust estimate of how many
people over 16 in England have blood sugar levels in a range indicating a high
risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, otherwise known as non-diabetic
It was commissioned by the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme (NHS DPP), which
will support people in reducing their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by
helping them lose weight, be more active and have a healthier diet. The new
estimate further underlines the need to act on Type 2 diabetes, especially as
it already results in 22,000 early deaths and costs the NHS £8.8 billion every
An evidence review also published today by PHE shows programmes similar to the
NHS DPP can be successful in preventing 26 per cent of people at high risk of
Type 2 diabetes from going on to develop the condition. People supported by
diabetes prevention programmes lose on average 1.57kg more weight than those
not on a programme aiming to significantly reduce diabetes risk.
Both reports have shaped what the NHS DPP will offer – at least nine months of
information, support, group and one-to-one sessions on weight loss, physical
activity and diet. Practitioners, clinicians, academics and the public are
currently being consulted on a proposed outline of the programme. Consultation
responses will further inform the programme, with a phased national roll-out
Duncan Selbie, Chief Executive of PHE, said: “We know how to lower the risk of
developing Type 2 diabetes: lose weight, exercise and eat healthily, but it’s
hard to do it alone. PHE’s evidence review shows that supporting people along
the way will help them protect their health and that’s what our prevention
Professor Jonathan Valabhji, National Clinical Director for Diabetes and
Obesity, NHS England said: “There are too many people on the cusp of
developing Type 2 diabetes and we can change that. The growing body of
evidence makes us confident that our NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme will
reduce the numbers of those at risk going on to develop the debilitating
## Helping people at high risk of Type 2 diabetes
Barbara Young, Chief Executive of Diabetes UK, said: “Having high blood
glucose significantly increases your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, which
is a serious health condition which affects 2.9 million people in England, and
can lead to devastating complications such as blindness, amputations and
“This is why we are delighted to be a part of England’s first ever evidence-
based National Diabetes Prevention Programme and we fully support the
programme’s ambition to help people at high risk of Type 2 diabetes to reduce
their risk by supporting them to become more active and have a healthier diet.
The evidence shows that this is the right approach as these types of
interventions can help people to lose significant amounts of weight, and can
also lower their blood glucose levels, therefore providing them with the best
possible chance to delay or avoid Type 2 diabetes.
“As well as helping to reduce the human cost of Type 2 diabetes, this would
also go a long way to helping to reduce economic costs to the NHS. The NHS
spends 10 per cent of its entire budget managing diabetes, and unless we get
better at preventing Type 2 diabetes this figure will rise to unsustainable
“While the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme is a major step in the right
direction, we now hope to see greater support from all areas of national and
local Government to encourage people to lead healthy and active lives.”
The data on non-diabetic hyperglycaemia are broken down by local authority for
the first time, ranging from 8.5 per cent of people in Brighton and Hove to 14
per cent in Harrow. Higher rates are found in areas with large ethnic minority
populations or older populations, or both – the groups traditionally at higher
risk of Type 2 diabetes. In addition to the inherent factors of ageing and
ethnic background, lifestyle factors, including weight, physical activity
levels and diet, also play a role in determining the risk of developing Type 2
The NHS DPP will focus on providing support to participants on changing their
behaviour in these areas to reduce their risk. According to the evidence
review, programmes more aligned with the NICE guidance on preventing or
delaying the onset of Type 2 diabetes help people lose on average 3kg more
Aside from reducing incidences of Type 2 diabetes, the NHS DPP also aims to
reduce the life-changing complications associated with the disease, like heart
disease, stroke, kidney, eye and foot problems, and reduce costs to the NHS in
People identified with a high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, either
through an NHS Health Check or through an existing blood test result, will be
offered a place on the NHS DPP when it launches in 2016.
