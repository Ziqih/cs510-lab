# What you need to know about this year's flu shot
There are many unknowns about how COVID-19 will affect this year’s flu season,
so if you haven't already, it’s time to see your doctor about getting the
annual flu shot. We recommend this as people with specific medical conditions
such as diabetes have a higher risk of severe outcomes with influenza.
##**What is the flu vaccine made up of?**
Each year the Australian Influenza Vaccine Committee (AIVC) reviews
recommendations from the World Health Organisation, and data relating to the
strains of recent influenza viral strains known to be circulating within
Australia. Based on this information the AIVC makes recommendations to The
Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) as to the viral strains that will be
contained in the yearly flu vaccine produced for Australia.
This year all the brand of vaccines are quadrivalent, meaning they have four
influenza viral strains in the egg-based vaccine. These four strains are:

Getting revaccinated in the same season is considered on an individual basis
and may be beneficial if an individual is travelling to the Northern
Hemisphere later in 2020, or pregnant. Children aged 6 months to less than 9
years, who are receiving the influenza vaccine for the first time, also
receive 2 doses, given at least four weeks apart.
Only **one** influenza vaccine is available for people eligible for the
government-funded vaccine each year, except children who are receiving the
influenza vaccine for the first time and require two doses.
The pneumococcal vaccine protects against the bacterium called _Streptococcus
pneumoniae_ that can cause invasive diseases such as meningitis and pneumonia.
* children, adolescents and adults with conditions that are associated with an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease.
The Australian Government funds pneumococcal vaccinations following the NIP
schedule. For people over 65 years, the pneumococcal vaccine is funded for
free one time only. This is not funded or required yearly.
For those children, adolescents and adults at high risk of invasive
pneumococcal disease or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults, a varied
immunisation schedule may exist, depending on the state in which you live.
Diabetes is listed as a condition associated with an increased risk of
