### Diabetes distress is what some people feel when they’re overwhelmed by the
relentlessness of diabetes. This can lead to diabetes burnout.
The way you react to things and the emotions you feel can vary for different
people. You might feel frustrated, guilty, sad or worried. Sometimes you might
feel all of these emotions and more from time to time. Feeling this way about
your diabetes is understandable and it’s a natural reaction for anyone that’s
been diagnosed with a long-term health condition. Knowing some of the signs
can help you start to manage these feelings.

* feeling angry about diabetes and frustrated about the demands of managing it
* worrying about not taking enough care of your diabetes but not feeling motivated to change

you don’t watch them go down, that just becomes blow after blow every day.
It’s not something you deal with every three months when you get your blood
test result, it’s something you’re dealing with on a daily basis, so it’s
taken me a long time to get used to doing sugar readings and accepting them.”
