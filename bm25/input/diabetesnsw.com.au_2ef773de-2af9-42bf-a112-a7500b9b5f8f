# Diabetes takes a toll on mental health
The pressure of living with diabetes takes a significant toll on the emotional
wellbeing of more than half of the people diagnosed with the condition.
This National Diabetes Week (July 12 to 18), Diabetes NSW & ACT CEO Sturt
Eastwood is asking the public to be aware of the extra pressure diabetes
places on the 435,000 people living with the condition in NSW.
“Research tells us that 71% of people with type 1 diabetes and 58% of people
with type 2 diabetes say the condition has a negative impact on their
emotional wellbeing[i],” said Mr Eastwood. “We also know that women who
develop gestational diabetes are more likely to experience depression during
“As a result, it’s estimated that the quality of life and mental health of
more than 220,000 people in NSW is affected by diabetes.”
The emotional burden of diabetes comes from the dozens of extra decisions
people living with the condition need to make every day. The social and
physical restrictions bought on by COVID-19 have added further stress and
Mr Eastwood, who lives with type 1 diabetes, said, “Once you’re diagnosed with
diabetes, you’re constantly making decisions that impact your health. Life is
### “The burden of these decisions can weigh you down in the best of times,
“Some of the things people living with diabetes have to think about include
‘What are my blood glucose levels? Why have they gone high? Why are they low?
Are my levels ok to drive? How many carbs are in that meal? Can I eat that
piece of fruit? Why does my diabetes monitor keep beeping?’ And much more.”
Mr Eastwood said looking after mental health and wellbeing is an important
foundation in the overall care of people living with diabetes.
“Diabetes, whether type 1, type 2, or gestational, needs to be managed daily
to reduce the risk of complications. It’s not a condition that can be ignored,
Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune condition that attacks insulin producing
cells in the pancreas. It has no known cause or cure. Once the condition
develops, it requires urgent medical treatment and daily insulin for the rest
Type 2 diabetes tends to develop progressively. It can be delayed or prevented
in almost 60 per cent of cases with a healthy, active lifestyle. About 377,000
people in NSW live with type 2 diabetes.
Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and puts both the mother and baby
at increased risk of type 2 diabetes later in life. The latest statistics show
there are 13,200 women living with gestational diabetes in NSW.
Diabetes NSW & ACT’s Psychologist Katherine Dixon said diabetes adds an extra
level of stress and anxiety to the simple things many of us take for granted.
“What I regularly hear from the people I talk to is that diabetes is
“The pressure never goes away. Even when you’re doing all the right things for
your health - eating well, exercising, taking your medication - when you have
diabetes you can end up with the wrong result. It can be hard to find the
right balance when your body doesn’t respond in the way you need it to.
“When you add an extra stress such as COVID-19, it can be overwhelming. This
is why I’ve seen a 30% increase in appointments since the pandemic started.”
Ms Dixon suggests five simple steps to help people with diabetes thrive, not
1.**P** ositivity – incorporate something that makes you feel good into your day.
2.**E** ngagement – be fully in the moment. When we’re in the zone we stop worrying about other things.
3.**R** elationships – create connections with people that help you and make you feel good.
4.**M** eaning – do something that gives you a sense of purpose.
5.**A** chievement – celebrate big and small achievements each day.
The impact of diabetes on the mental and emotional health of people living
