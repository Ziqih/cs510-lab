4 good handfuls of green salad leaves, to serve
1. To make the coleslaw: chop spring onion and cabbage finely, grate the carrots and combine it in a bowl with vinegar and pepper, stir well until combined. Cover with glad wrap and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before use.
2. Next up, make the chicken. In a small saucepan, combine the tomato sauce, chillies, paprika, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic. Stir well to combine, and add the chicken. 
3. Cover with a lid, and cook over a low heat for around 1.5 hours, until the chicken is soft and can be pulled apart with a fork. Alternatively, if you have a slow cooker, pop the chicken in there on low for approximately 3 hours.
4. Once the chicken is soft, use two forks to pull the chicken apart into strands.
5. To assemble the sliders, place a good dollop of coleslaw onto the base of the mini burger roll. 
6. Add some chicken and some coriander, and cover with the top of the burger roll.
7. Serve with a good handful of green salad!
