>>>>>>> ## **Meet our Volunteer Spotlight for January 2021, Charlie
>>>>>>> When Charlie’s career came to an end earlier than anticipated in 2017,
a friend suggested that he volunteer. In 2018, Charlie made the step to find
out more and apply to be one of our volunteers. He attended his induction
training at the beginning of that year, and helped at his first event on World
Diabetes Day in November. He helped to run an awareness stand at the
University of Sunderland in London Docklands. Charlie describes this as a “big
moment” because it was the first time that he’d spoken about his diabetes in
public. Charlie lives with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA), a rare
form of autoimmune diabetes. He’s shared his story of being diagnosed and the
>>>>>>> Charlie’s supported at many awareness events over the last few years;
at stalls, helping people to know their risk of developing type 2 and talking
>>>>>>> “I always enjoy the awareness events; we’ve done quite a few for
British Rail and companies go out of their way to make you feel welcome. You
get everything at the stalls; I always enjoy interacting with the other stall
holders. For the four to five hours that you’re there, people can ask you
anything. I also enjoy meeting other volunteers. We have students helping who
are taking time off their studies to do it. Volunteers are giving up their
time for free and they’re incredibly passionate about what they do.”
>>>>>>> Charlie’s also regularly fundraised for our charity. He first took
part in our One Million Steps Challenge in 2018 and has participated every
year since. Charlie was invited by the Fundraising Team to talk at their 2019
conference about his experience doing the challenge. He wasn’t told how many
people would be there, and he was glad he wasn’t warned, as there was a huge
>>>>>>> As well as volunteering and fundraising for us, Charlie’s a type 2
champion for the London Clinical Network, bringing his experience and insight
into discussions with clinicians. He’s also a part of North West London
Partners in Diabetes helping the patient voice be heard.
>>>>>>> ### **A life changing moment for Charlie**
>>>>>>> Twelve months ago, Charlie experienced a life changing event; he had
open heart surgery followed by cardiac rehab. Six weeks on from his operation
he was getting fit again. His recuperation was going well, and then the
>>>>>>> Not able to complete his physio in the gym, Charlie set up exercise
equipment in his back garden and continued. Charlie decided he would take part
in the 2020 One Million Steps Challenge and this gave him a goal to work
towards, especially with coming back to health and fitness and with
>>>>>>> Charlie completed over 1.7 million steps, the distance from Land’s End
to John O’ Groats. He did 20,000 steps a day managing to raise over £1,500.
>>>>>>> Charlie’s success with the One Million Steps Challenge over the last
few years led to a call from the Fundraising Team in summer 2020 asking him if
he’d like to be a One Million Steps Ambassador. This role involved being an
active part in the team, writing articles and blogs and posting about his
challenge on Facebook, something Charlie threw himself into, posting funny or
>>>>>>> Charlie returned to volunteering in May 2020 after recovering from his
operation. He found that things had needed to change because coronavirus
restrictions prevented face-to-face volunteering. This didn’t deter Charlie
and, over the course of the year, he attended more virtual events, wrote more
articles and did more interviews than he had in the previous two years.
>>>>>>> Charlie’s learnt new digital skills, sharing his screen to give
presentations on Microsoft Teams and Zoom and using other online platforms
he’s never used before. Giving talks online can be hard, says Charlie, “when
it’s just you and your laptop, it can feel impersonal as an experience because
you don’t know how well it’s being received.”
>>>>>>> However, moving online does have its advantages. He’s found that
talks, meetings and events are now more accessible for a wider group of people
because they can join from wherever they are.
>>>>>>> In his role with the North West London Partners in Diabetes, Charlie
was part of a team that put together a live online chat show called ‘Homeshow’
in November 2020 discussing managing diet and exercise. This event went really
well with about 30 people joining. The team are now planning more events.
>>>>>>> Charlie also wrote various articles and blogs for the ‘Know Diabetes’
website in 2020, such as the benefits of daily exercise and his experience
doing the One Million Steps Challenge. Plus, we asked Charlie to write about
his lockdown experience and the importance of having a routine, especially for
>>>>>>> Charlie’s planning to continue helping at online events with our
London regional team and continuing his work with the North West London
Partners in Diabetes. Charlie’s also given back to Harefield Hospital where he
had his heart surgery. He’s trained in Digital Storytelling, helping to
produce a series of short patient stories with voice overs accompanying
photos. He’s started with his own story from the beginning right through to
his recovery and the One Million Steps Challenge.

volunteer journey, Charlie says “be yourself, live and learn and enjoy
