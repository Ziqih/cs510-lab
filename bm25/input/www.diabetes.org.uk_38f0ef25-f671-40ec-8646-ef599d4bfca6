**With lots of myths and claims surrounding diabetes, especially to do with
food, it can be confusing to work out what you can and can’t eat.**
But there is no such thing as a diabetic diet – people with diabetes are
advised to eat a healthy, balanced diet, just like everyone else. Take a look
at our top tips to eating well with diabetes as a starter for ten.
Yes. Diabetes doesn't mean you have to miss out on the joys of baking and
cakes. Just think about portion sizes and how often you have them – to help
you space out your portions, you can freeze most cakes and breads. Make sure
you wrap items in foil and label them before putting into freezer bags. You
could also try eating your desserts with some fruit, such as berries, to make

Yes. There’s no need to cut chocolate out of your diet completely if you have
diabetes. You can still enjoy it as part of a healthy, balanced diet, or for
special occasions. Try to eat small portions at a time because eating a lot in
one go can affect your blood sugar levels. One tip is to go for 70% cocoa dark
chocolate, as it's a stronger taste and means you’re likely to eat a bit less.
We don't recommend ‘diabetic’ chocolate. It’s just as high in fat and calories
as regular chocolate, and is often more expensive as well.

Although we know fruits and vegetables are good for us, people with diabetes
are often told they can’t eat fruit because they are too sweet or contain
sugar. All fruits contain natural sugar, but also contain a good mix of
vitamins, minerals and fibre that we need to eat as part of a healthy,
balanced diet. So yes, it's really important people with diabetes eat fruit.
Most people with diabetes can safely drink alcohol in moderation, while eating
a healthy, balanced diet and keeping active. It’s best to avoid drinking more
than 14 units of alcohol a week – this is about the equivalent of six medium
glasses of wine or six pints of lager.
It’s important to be aware of how alcohol affects the body and how you can
manage this. Alcohol can increase the risk of having a hypo, especially if you
drink a lot in one go or on an empty stomach.

Yes, although you should reduce your portion sizes to avoid affecting your
blood sugar levels too much. You could also try making your own pizza, which
is likely to be much healthier than one you’d buy as a takeaway, especially if
