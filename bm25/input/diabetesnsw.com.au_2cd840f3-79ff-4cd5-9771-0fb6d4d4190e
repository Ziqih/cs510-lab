Adding strength training, push-ups or crunches to your weekly exercise routine
could decrease your likelihood of obesity by half.
Using data on 1.7 million adults, University of Southern Queensland (USQ)
research found that doing muscle-strengthening activities twice a week was
just as effective for obesity reduction as the current recommended amount of
In fact, the research showed that combining the two forms of exercise halved
the odds of obesity. The findings were published on November 11 in the journal
Lead author, Dr Jason Bennie who is a Senior Research Fellow at USQ’s
Physically Active Lifestyles Research Group, said the study provided the
strongest evidence to date of the best amount of physical activity required to
“It is estimated that almost 40 per cent of Australian adults are obese, and
this condition can lead to increased risk of health conditions such as
diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and depression,” Dr Bennie said.
“Until now most population-level evidence on physical activity for reducing
the risk of, or preventing obesity is based on aerobic exercise, such as
walking, cycling and jogging, but few studies have previously examined the
“From the data we analysed, it’s great news for people who find it hard to get
out and exercise, but can potentially do some strength training at home.
“The findings will greatly extend our understanding of the complex
relationship between physical activity and obesity, and potentially lead to
Australia’s Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines recommend 150
to 300 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity or 75 to 150 minutes of
vigorous intensity physical activity each week. The Guidelines also recommend
doing muscle-strengthening activities at least two days per week.
Dr Bennie hoped the results from the study would be good motivation for people
“Physical activity doesn’t need to be complicated or time-consuming,” he said.
“Doing any physical activity is better than none and making some changes to
your daily routine can make a big difference like body weight exercises such
as squats, sit-ups, or push-ups at home; or join a gym to do weights.”
