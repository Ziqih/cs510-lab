The Bath Half is one of the longest established and most popular city centre
road events in the UK. The course is fast and flat making it suitable for all
abilities, from complete beginners, to more regular long-distance event
runners looking to beat their personal best time.
As one of the Bath Half Marathon 2021 top-tier partners we are planning on
taking Bath by storm, so why not join us?
## What sort of place should I register for?
Join our amazing team by purchasing one of our charity places in the event.
With a minimum sponsorship target of £250, we will be there to support you
every step of the way. **Registration is just £1 until the end of January** so
Have you bought a place directly from the Bath Half Marathon race organiser?
If so, you can still enjoy all of the benefits of being a part of our team,
without having a minimum sponsorship target. We just need a few details from
you in order to be able to support you in the best way possible, so register
We would love to hear from you and answer any questions you may have. Contact
