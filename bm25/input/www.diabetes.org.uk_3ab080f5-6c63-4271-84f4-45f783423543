All of us, whether we have diabetes or not, need some dairy products (or non-
dairy alternatives like soya products) such as milk, cheese and yogurt every
day. These all contain proteins and vitamins and are an important source of
calcium, which help to keep your bones and teeth strong.
Some dairy foods, however, can be high in fat and saturated fat, so choose
Adults and older children who consume too much fat may find they gain weight
and too much saturated fat can cause your cholesterol levels to rise, which
increases your risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Unfortunately, diabetes
increases your risk of having CVD, so it pays to opt for the lower-fat options
Switching to lower-fat milk, such as semi-skimmed milk (green top) from whole
milk (blue top), which contains the most fat, is a good start. To make even
more of a difference, try 1 per cent fat milk (orange top) or even better
skimmed milk (red top). Lower-fat milks have all the goodness of whole milk,
including calcium, all you lose is the fat.
This table shows the savings you could make. The figures are for 100ml but
bear in mind a pint is 568ml, which many of us consume each day on cereal and
in cups of tea and coffee. It shows how the savings can really add up.

To help you see if your favourite milk or cheese (see table below) is low,
medium or high in fat, saturated fat, total sugars and salt we have colour
coded the information in the table in line with government guidelines. The
colour coding tells you if the product has low (green), medium (amber) or high
(red) amounts of fat, total sugar and salt per 100g or 100ml.
Cheese can be high in fat and salt, so keep a check on your portion sizes. The
recommended serving size is 30g/1oz – about the size of a matchbox.
Cheeses such as Cheddar, Leicester, Gloucester, Lancashire, Brie, Blue cheese
and Edam are all high in fat, typically containing between 20­–40g fat per
100g. Remember when looking at labels, that foods with more than 17.5g of fat
Cheese can also be high in salt (more than 1.5g per 100g is considered high)
and too much salt can raise your blood pressure, which is not good for your
If you love cheese, opt for Brie, Edam and reduced fat-hard cheeses, eg
‘lighter Cheddar’, which are lower in fat compared to Blue cheeses, such as
stilton and regular hard cheeses, but remember they still are high in fat and
saturated fat so keep an eye on that portion size.
It pays to shop around, as the ‘reduced-fat’ cheeses can vary considerably
typically ranging from 10 to 22g fat per 100g so again check the labels. For
even healthier alternatives, try cottage cheese, Quark and reduced-fat cream
cheeses which are lower in fat and salt.
Make hard cheese go further by grating it instead of slicing and opt for
mature cheese as a little goes a long way due to the stronger taste.
This table highlights the differences in fat between some of the popular

**Quark** | 68 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 3.8 | 3.8 | 0.1
Yogurts and fromage frais can vary widely in their fat content, too, so check
the label and go for the lower-fat options. Bear in mind, though, that food
manufactures sometimes replace the fat with added sugar to compensate for the
change in taste and texture after the fat is removed. A 150g pot of yogurt or
fromage frais can often contain 20g of added sugar (equivalent to 5 tsps) in
addition to the 6–12g of lactose – the natural sugar already in milk.
A good option is natural yogurt or low-fat Greek yogurt which you can sweeten
by adding chopped fruit, which will also help bump up your five a day fruit
### Can eating yogurt prevent Type 2 diabetes?
A study published in 2014 looked at the link between eating yogurt and the
risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and it found that people who ate large
amounts of yogurt cut their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. However, the
length of the study was too short to draw any firm conclusions, despite being
reported as such in many newspapers. More research is needed before we can
change our advice. What we do know is that the best way to reduce your risk of
Type 2 diabetes is by maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active
and eating a healthy, balanced diet that’s low in salt, fat and sugar.
### What effect does eating dairy foods have on my blood glucose levels?
The glycaemic index (GI) tells us whether a food raises blood glucose levels
quickly, moderately or slowly. This means it can be useful to help you manage
your diabetes. Carbohydrates are digested and absorbed at different rates, and
GI is a ranking of how quickly each carbohydrate-based food and drink makes
blood glucose levels rise after eating them. Milk and other dairy food
generally have a low GI because of the moderate GI effect of the lactose
(natural sugar in milk), plus the effect of the milk protein, which slows down
Children should be given whole milk and dairy products until they are two
years old because they may not get all the essential vitamins they need from
lower-fat dairy products. Don’t give children skimmed milk until they are at
