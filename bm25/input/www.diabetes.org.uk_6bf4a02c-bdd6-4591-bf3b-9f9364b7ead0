**You need certain health checks when you have diabetes. You might hear this
called your annual review, but you don’t always get these once a year.**
During the coronavirus pandemic, your diabetes care is going to look a bit
different for a while. Here’s what to expect.
When you have diabetes, you’re entitled to certain checks, tests and services
to help you get the care you need – like your HbA1c blood test. These checks
help to prevent serious diabetes complications, like problems with your feet,
During coronavirus, many routine appointments like your annual diabetes review
have been cancelled or postponed. We know this may be worrying, but you should
be able to reschedule as things get back to normal. In some areas, these
appointments are being held over the phone or by video call instead. It might
feel strange having appointments in a different way to normal, but we've got
lots of advice on preparing for remote diabetes appointments.
Some people with diabetes who have more urgent care needs are being
prioritised, for example if you’re already having treatment for a foot or eye
problem, or if you’re pregnant. If you are invited to an appointment in
person, your healthcare professionals will be wearing protective equipment and
appointments will be scheduled to avoid busy waiting areas. It's really
It's important that the doctor or team responsible for your diabetes care keep
you updated on what to expect right now and explain when your next review will
be. If you're worried or have questions, contact them to find out more.
We know that some people with diabetes may not have been able to get their
HbA1c, cholesterol, and kidney function blood tests right now. But some
hospitals and general practices are collecting samples for HbA1c by post or by
If you have not had a blood test in the last year and you are worried, ask
And if you use a flash glucose monitor or continuous glucose monitor, you
should be able to share your time in range readings with your clinical team
online. This will help your team see how your blood sugars are doing without
If you don’t have high blood pressure, then you probably won’t be invited to a
blood pressure check for some time. But if you are invited for a blood test,
ask if your blood pressure can be taken at the same time.
In some areas, diabetes care teams have suggested people buy their own home
blood pressure monitoring kit. You can find a list of blood pressure monitors
to use at home from the British and Irish Hypertension Society website.
We know that won’t be possible for everyone, and we don’t think people should
have to pay for these devices. We’re calling on the NHS to find other ways to
If you're invited for a blood test or blood pressure check, your team might
want you to do a urine test at the same time to check that your kidneys are
working properly. If you're not sure when you last had this test, ask your
team about how soon you might need to have this done again.
As with other routine diabetes care, foot services may be prioritising those
at most risk. So if you don’t have any current problems with your feet, you
may be waiting a little longer. However, it’s important your diabetes team let
**It’s never been more important tocheck your feet and legs everyday – here we
show you how to do it and what to look for. If you spot something new you're
concerned about, like a cut or blister on your foot, call your GP practice and
explain your situation - don't delay. If you can't get through, call 111 for
Eye screening has been restarted in some areas, but will have reduced capacity
to ensure it is delivered safely. This means that appointments will be
prioritised to those most at risk of experiencing sight loss, including:
* people who already have eye problems (background or more advanced retinopathy)
* if you haven't had any screening in the past.
**If you are invited to a screening appointment it’s really important you go.
And if you notice any changes to your eyesight, these should be checked as
soon as possible – gradual changes can be checked by your optician, but if you
notice any sudden changes get urgent medical care.**
If your most recent screening test result showed no signs of retinopathy, this
means you are in the group of people with diabetes who are lowest risk of
retinopathy. Evidence gathered over several years shows it is now safe for you
to wait up to 24 months between screening appointments. There is very little
chance you will develop sight-threatening retinopathy between appointments.
Keep taking your medication and speak to your local pharmacist if you have
