>>>>>>> # Research spotlight - what causes Type 1 diabetes?
>>>>>>> ### Our immune system normally protects us against infection and
illness. But in Type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the cells in the
pancreas that make insulin – the hormone responsible for regulating levels of
>>>>>>> ### Scientists are working hard to find out what causes this to
>>>>>>> The genetics of Type 1 diabetes isn’t simple. There’s no single gene
that, if inherited from your parents, means you’re going to develop Type 1
>>>>>>> In fact, there are a number of genes involved in Type 1 diabetes.
These genes don’t ‘give’ you Type 1 diabetes, but increase the chances of you
developing it. The more high risk genes you have, the more likely you are to
>>>>>>> But having several high risk genes doesn’t mean you will definitely
develop Type 1. Take genetically identical twins as an example. There are
pairs of identical twins where one twin develops Type 1 diabetes, and the
other doesn’t. This means that our risk of Type 1 diabetes isn’t solely linked
>>>>>>> The number of people being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes is on the
rise. And this number is rising too quickly for Type 1 diabetes to be down to
genes alone – our genes can’t change that quickly. Something else is
contributing to this increase in Type 1 diabetes.
>>>>>>> Scientists believe that our environment plays a role in the
development of Type 1 diabetes, in combination with these high risk genes.
>>>>>>> * We're funding BOX: the longest running family study of
Type 1 diabetes in the world. It began in 1985 and tracks the health of over
3,900 families who include a child with Type 1 diabetes. Read about BOX.
>>>>>>> * Our Harry Keen fellow Dr Richard Oram found a way to
calculate somebody’s genetic risk of Type 1 diabetes. They found Type 1
occurred relatively evenly across the first six decades of life – meaning you
can live with ‘high risk’ genes for a long time before developing Type 1
diabetes. Read more about Dr Oram’s discovery, and what his team are working
>>>>>>> Several viruses have been associated with Type 1 diabetes, but one
type of virus, called Human Enteroviruses (HEVs), have the strongest body of
evidence. HEVs are a large family of viruses that enter the gut and are spread
through poor hygiene or sanitation. One of the most famous HEVs is the polio
virus, but most HEVs aren’t as serious as polio and can appear as a common
flu-like infection that the immune system will clear on its own.
>>>>>>> Small studies have found traces of HEVs in pancreas samples from
people newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, and from people who have lived
with Type 1 for a long time. Some research has suggested that a baby’s risk of
Type 1 diabetes is higher if their mother picks up a HEV during pregnancy. But
the evidence is mixed, and no conclusions can be drawn yet. We know that our
immune system responds to viruses, but we don’t yet know if or how a HEV
infection could lead to Type 1 diabetes. There are several possible theories:
>>>>>>> * HEVs might look similar to parts of insulinproducing cells
in the pancreas, causing the immune system to mistakenly attack the cells.
>>>>>>> * HEV infections might expose insulinproducing cells to the
immune system in an unusual way, leading to an attack.
>>>>>>> * HEV infections might change how insulinproducing cells
work, making them appear as a threat to the immune system.
>>>>>>> * We’re funding Professor Noel Morgan at the University of
Exeter to understand how and why some insulin-producing cells lose their
ability to fight off viral infections during the development of Type 1
>>>>>>> * TEDDY is one of the biggest studies trying to uncover the
environmental triggers of Type 1 diabetes. It’s investigating many factors,
>>>>>>> The ‘microbiome’ describes all of the different bacteria and other
microorganisms living inside us. Most of these are found in our gut. They can
influence our health in different ways, including how our immune system works
>>>>>>> There are a number of factors that could affect the gut microbiome,
such as whether a baby is born via caesarean delivery, our diets during early
childhood and the use of antibiotics. All of these are intertwined with how
the gut microbiome develops and how diverse it is, which appears to be
important in the development of Type 1 diabetes.
>>>>>>> Studies have shown that the gut microbiome in children with Type 1
diabetes is different compared to children without Type 1. There is even
evidence to suggest that there are fewer types of bacteria in children who
show early signs of Type 1 diabetes but haven’t been diagnosed yet.
>>>>>>> * TEDDY is also studying the importance of the gut
microbiome by collecting and analysing stool samples, and keeping dietary
>>>>>>> Scientists have questioned whether our diet during childhood could
influence our risk of Type 1 diabetes. Cows’ milk, gluten, cereals, omega-3,
vitamin D and breast-feeding are all being studied. But the evidence is often
contradictory, making it hard to pinpoint which factors could be the most
important, both in protecting people from developing Type 1 or increasing the
>>>>>>> Hygiene, pollutants, vaccines, maternal age, psychological stress and
seasonal variation have all been put forward as possible environmental factors
involved in Type 1 diabetes. It’s a lot to take in, and we don’t have any
definitive answers yet, but there’s no shortage of research going on.
>>>>>>> The take home message: the full picture is still unclear. We still
don’t fully understand whether one, or a combination, of these factors causes
someone at high risk of Type 1 diabetes to actually develop the condition.
>>>>>>> It’s even possible that the timing of the environmental trigger plays
a role in this risk. And the way each environmental trigger might lead to Type
1 could also be different. Taken together, this might help to explain why
>>>>>>> Hands up, it’s complicated. But scientists across the world are
working hard to understand just how important each suspected trigger could be,
and who they could affect in the future. Piecing together this puzzle this
will lead us to ways of preventing, delaying or even curing Type 1 diabetes in
