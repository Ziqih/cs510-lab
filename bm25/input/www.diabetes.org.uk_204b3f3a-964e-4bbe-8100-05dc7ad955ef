An article written by psychologist Dr Jen Nash, who has Type 1 diabetes.
Many of us feel that the end of the year is a time to make changes and set New
Year’s resolutions - which we all know are often over by mid-January...
Managing a long term condition like diabetes, that requires a great deal of
self-management, means that reflection and planning is a really important part
of achieving the results that lead not just to health, but also to an all-
This article aims to support you to reflect on 2016 and look ahead to plan for
any changes you feel are needed for 2017.
As someone living with diabetes, you know that you don’t have to be defined by
it, or any of the outcomes - whether it’s blood glucose readings, your weight,
cholesterol or blood pressure, or the number of hypos and hypers you have.
However, these numerical values can feel negative when they are not as we
But, measuring ourselves doesn’t have to be a negative thing if we can instead
adjust our mindset and view it as feedback, as something may need to be
Look back over the year and reflect on:
* 3+ things you’re most pleased with when it comes to your health
* 3+ aspects you would have liked to be different
As well as the more obvious areas such as following dietary and exercise
recommendations, smoking and alcohol use, look as broadly as you can to
consider other factors. These could be aspects such as your attendance at
health appointments, having your annual eye screening, learning about diabetes
Look at the list of 3+ things you would have liked to be different. See them
as clues that indicate that something could be changed in this area.
For example, high or low blood glucose readings may be evidence that your
medication doses may need to be changed, timing of meals and snacks could be
altered, weight gain could be a clue that your diet be improved.
Don’t forget that there are many influences and several of them can’t be
As you’re doing this reflection, take notice of your inner conversation. Self-
judgement can be really common amongst people living with diabetes. It’s a
medical condition, and the focus is often on the medical and numerical aspect
of our efforts. However, it’s hard to untangle the personal effort we put in
to living with the condition with the medical outcomes we often see.
Although diabetes management involves literal measurements (blood glucose,
weight etc), aim to ensure you are also not judging yourself unfairly (against
people without diabetes, against others HbA1C readings etc). Knowing
you are keeping going and making some effort each day will help you to
untangle those feelings and ideas of self-worth when you consider your
We often talk much more harshly to ourselves than we would ever talk to
friends and family members. Diabetes requires us to develop a compassionate
I have found that asking myself, ‘What would I do or say to myself right now
if I was being a good mum (or dad) to myself?’ really helps. Great parents are
usually loving, but also kind enough to speak the truth when it needs to be
told. Is it possible to develop the same style in your ‘inner talk’ to
If I find myself avoiding doing what I know I ‘should’, such as eating more
than I need, I’ve come to realise that it’s often because the food (or
avoidance of the blood glucose testing etc) is the best way I know how to take
It usually signals there’s an ‘inner need’ that needs to be met in that
moment, and if I can find an alternative way to get that need met, the need to
overeat becomes much less compelling. For example, if I’m nervous about
something ahead, the desire to eat may be around, and whilst food may numb and
distract this, the kinder thing may be to do what I can to prepare for the
event, or talk to someone or get advice about it.
Asking myself the question, ‘why?’ about behaviour like this, is really key.
Having done your reflections for 2016, is there anything you need to change?
If you’re happy with your progress this year, congratulations! Perhaps you’d
like to share your news with someone or give yourself a well-deserved reward,
If you’re concerned you’re not making the progress or seeing the outcome that
you’d like, congratulations for this insight too. Awareness of your situation
is key to change, and the most important step in moving towards an outcome
Looking at your reflections, is there one thing that immediately jumps out you
can do differently? Starting with the smallest and easiest step is the one to
begin with, as you’re more likely to achieve it and this often brings momentum
to then tackle more challenging goals. This is also a great time to review
whether it’s time to find out what support you can get from your diabetes
healthcare team and make an appointment with the relevant professional.

Wherever you are on your diabetes journey, there’s always time to make
changes, with a view to making your condition become more manageable when
handled in the best way. Although New Year is a great time to make a
change, taking small and manageable steps toward your overall health goals
throughout the months ahead will mean this time next year you’ll be
celebrating what a great 2017 you were able to create!
