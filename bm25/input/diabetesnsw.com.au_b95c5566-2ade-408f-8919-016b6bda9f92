It’s the start of a new year and a perfect time to review your medications. If
you need some assistance you could sign up for a Home Medicines Review, a
Medscheck or make an appointment with your GP. This is the quietest time of
the year for many medical practices and pharmacies, and hopefully for you, so
take advantage of the season to get on top of your meds in 2020.
If you take or use five or more medications regardless of what they are
treating and haven’t had a review in the last two years you are eligible for a
Home Medicines Review. A specially trained pharmacist will review your
medications for possible unwanted effects and give you extra information on
your medications at a home visit. You can request this service through your
Medschecks are a shorter interview you can have with your pharmacist at the
pharmacy. These free services will give you and your GP valuable feedback on
Here is a list of possible medication side-effects or diabetes-related event
checklist for you to start the audit process. Do you experience any of these?
Change in appetite| Constipation| Diarrhoea/ loose motions| Irregular or fast
Change in blood pressure| Change in urine or bowel motion colour| Insomnia|
Low blood glucose events (hypos)| Dramatic change in your diet| Gut pain or
Unexplained tiredness| Depression/ Distress| Swelling of ankles| Shortness of
Persistent cold or coughing| Rash/ dryness of skin| Dry mouth or eyes|
Pain on urination| Genital pain| Recurring thrush| Rising glucose levels
Yellowing of skin| Weight gain| Unexplained muscle pain| Thirst
If any of the above apply you may want to book an appointment with your GP for
a diabetes medication review. Most times the unwanted effects of medications
start with the medication or soon after. But it is possible that these
unwanted effects can start when something else changes with your body
functions, such as your kidney function or if you have started taking another
medication. Other things such as a heart attack,or stroke or change in
mobility also change the way medications work in your body.
It may be a good time to ask your GP what to do with your medication on sick
days and if you are planning a medical procedure.
Diabetes changes over time and it’s important to do an annual cycle of care to
identify any health concerns early and discuss the best treatment with your GP
and diabetes health professionals. At this check up you can discuss your
medications to make sure you are on the right ones for you. It could make a
Diabetes NSW & ACT run regular annual cycle of care events throughout the
year. Find an annual cycle of care near you.
If you have type 2 diabetes you may also benefit from attending a MedSmart
course. These workshops teach you all about the basics of diabetes and
digestion, so that you can understand more about your medications.
