# Charity Golf Day raising funds for kids with type 1
Join us at the Concord Golf Club on Monday 26 November for the Odgers
Berndtson and Diabetes NSW & ACT’s Charity Golf Day 2018. Enjoy a fantastic
day of golf, followed by a Gala dinner and auction as you help support
The day is set up for enjoyment and fun. We will be playing an Ambrose style
competition to allow for all levels of handicap, and in line with our drive
for diversity and inclusion, each fourball that has at least one female member
will have a full stroke deducted from their final score.
##**Have fun and help children living with diabetes**
Funds raised on the day will go to the Diabetes Kids Fund to deliver important
programs and services for children living with diabetes, their families and
carers so they have the support they need to live well. Programs and services
* Family camps and picnics where the kids learn more about managing their diabetes
* Specialist training for teachers and mentors caring for kids with diabetes
* Transport for disadvantaged families to travel to camps or medical appointments
* ‘Information kits’ to help families adjust to the diagnosis and life with diabetes
* Resources for families where English is not their first language
Without the support of corporate sponsors the day would not be possible and
this year we are pleased to be able to offer a tax benefit to sponsors. You
can review the sponsorship packages and benefits by downloading the brochure
below. As with previous years we expect the packages to go fast – so don’t
delay to sign up and confirm your support.
This will be a great day of golf and networking that will make a big
difference to the lives of children living with diabetes. We hope to see you
