It is frustrating when blood glucose levels are constantly above or below your
target range during the day. But it is even more concerning when this is
happening overnight. Firstly, it can interrupt much needed sleep, secondly
hypos overnight need to be avoided and lastly, overnight represents a
significant portion of the day, so being in target helps your overall average
There are many reasons why blood glucose levels could be out of target
* forgetting your medications or insulin, or taking the wrong dose
* eating additional carbs at dinner or before bed
* an incorrect carb count and insulin dose at dinner
* the wrong correction dose of insulin before bed
* drinking more than two glasses of alcohol
It is important you know your blood glucose targets during the day and for
overnight. If you are unsure, discuss it with your diabetes team. Make sure
you also know what blood glucose target you are aiming for around 2-3am as
well. An occasional overnight or morning blood glucose level that is out of
target can be expected, but if you notice a pattern of out of target blood
glucose levels it needs to be addressed. An unexplained hypoglycaemia event
should not occur overnight. If it does it is advised to reduce the insulin
dose that works at this time overnight to prevent it happening again.
If you see a pattern of out of target blood glucose levels occurring then it
is time to reflect on why. Is it a cause that can be corrected? If not, your
insulin dose(s) may need to be reviewed. It is always best to assess the basal
or long acting insulin first, followed by the quick acting insulin if you take
The basal insulin should keep the blood glucose steady during the day and
overnight, as its role is to match the liver's secretion of glucose. You can
get an idea of what is happening overnight by doing an overnight basal test.
You can discuss this with your diabetes team.
When the basal insulin is right for you your blood glucose level should be
approximately 2mmol/L higher or lower before breakfast from your bedtime blood
glucose level. If the basal insulin falls by more than this your basal insulin
dose is too much and will need to be reduced. If your blood glucose level
rises by more than 2mmol/L overnight your basal insulin dose might be too low.
However, you should not increase your basal insulin in this case until you
If your blood glucose level increased steadily from before bed, 3am and again
in the morning, your basal insulin dose is not enough and you need to increase
it. If your blood glucose level was stable from before bed until 3am and only
increased from 3am to waking then you may have the dawn phenomenon. It is not
wise to increase the basal insulin in this circumstance, as it could result in
The dawn phenomenon is a normal rise in blood glucose for some people as their
body prepares to wake up. In the early morning hours, hormones such as the
growth hormone and cortisol cause the liver to release glucose into the blood.
At least having a reason to explain above target blood glucose levels in the
morning is helpful; however, it can remain frustrating.
Managing the dawn phenonema is an ongoing research area but starting basal
insulin for those with type 2 diabetes is believed to assist in reducing the
production of glucose from the liver overnight. For those already on insulin
injections, it is important to consider the 3am blood glucose level before
increasing the basal insulin further. For those on an insulin pump basal rates
at that time of day can be increased. Lifestyle changes may also assist in
reducing the dawn phenonema, suggestions include evening exercise, eating less
carb and more protein with the evening meal, and not skipping the breakfast
Your diabetes team will be happy to assist you to troubleshoot the reasons and
possible solutions for out of target blood glucose levels.
