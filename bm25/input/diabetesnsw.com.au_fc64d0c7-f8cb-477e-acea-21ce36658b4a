# Train your brain: exercise and brain health
We all know that exercise is great for our bodies – it can help us become
fitter, stronger and generally healthier. But did you know that it can also
improve your brain power? There is a growing body of evidence that indicates
regular exercise not only improves cognitive function, but also helps
safeguard us against conditions such as dementia and age-related cognitive
Research shows that people who spend between three and 15 hours a day sitting
typically have less brain volume in the area that is associated with memory
and thinking (called the Hippocampus). In many ways prolonged sitting can be
likened to smoking in terms of the negative impact on our health.
This information further adds to our understanding that being sedentary, or
getting little movement throughout the day, is bad for our health and may lead
to a more rapid decline in your memory.
Exercise is thought to benefit our brain health for a number of reasons. We
know that the brain requires a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients in
order to function effectively. Exercise is a great way of effectively
'feeding' the blood vessels in our brain with nutrient-rich blood due to the
Exercise can also make our brains bigger! Aerobic exercise, in particular, has
been shown to lead to the growth of new brain cells (called neurons). This can
increase our overall brain volume – particularly in the hippocampus. This area
of the brain plays an important role with memory and learning.
 **Lowers your risk of dementia** – regular physical activity at all stages of
life has be shown to lower your risk of dementia and slow the process of
cognitive decline that occurs as we age. In fact, there is strong correlations
between someone’s cardiorespiratory fitness and their ability to carry out
 **Enhances memory** – we know that our memory can become a bit more foggy as
we get older, or even when we are younger! Exercise has been shown to help
boost our memory through helping preserve our existing brain cells, as well as
promoting growth of new brain cells in areas of the brain that we use for
 **Helps with learning –** research has shown that exercising after learning
something new can help you retain this new information or skill in your long-
 **Boosts your mood** – exercise is also effective in boosting the amount of
“feel good” hormones that are released by our brain such as endorphins,
dopamine and serotonin. This not only leaves you feeling great, it can also
help in managing the symptoms of depression and anxiety.
Essentially any form of exercise that is good for your heart, will also
* Aerobic exercise such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling and swimming are great for brain and heart health.
* Try and exercise at an intensity that is somewhat challenging (moderate) or enough to elevate your breathing rate slightly. This has been shown to offer more benefits in terms of our health.
* Add variety to your exercise. Mix up your routine and try and incorporate activities that challenge coordination and cardiovascular fitness at the same time, such as dancing or an aerobics class.
* Try and include a combination of different exercise types such as aerobic and strength-based exercise. Including both exercise modes has been shown to be more beneficial in improving cognitive function and overall diabetes management.
* Stay active both physically and mentally throughout the day. Try and challenge yourself by including activities that are new, complex and outside your normal routine. This could be as simple as switching to your non-dominant hand for tasks around the house, walking a different route to the shops, taking up a creative hobby or trying to learn a new skill (learning an instrument, gardening, creative writing).

people living with diabetes. An Accredited Exercise Physiologist guides you
through the program, including an initial one-on-one consultation to ensure
the exercises are individualised to meet your goals and needs.
Exercise sessions are held twice a week for one-hour and involve moderate
intensity aerobic, strength and balance based exercises as well as education
sessions on healthy living topics. Groups consist of 10-15 people who are
working towards similar goals of improving health, fitness and overall
A recent study of BEAT IT program results from across NSW and ACT showed that
people participating in the BEAT IT program were able to reduce their waist
circumference and significantly improve their aerobic fitness, strength,
