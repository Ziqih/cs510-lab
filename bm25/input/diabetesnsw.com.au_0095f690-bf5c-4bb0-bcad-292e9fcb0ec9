... Less sitting is good for your mental health
# Less sitting is good for your mental health
Researchers have found that if we break up periods of sitting and being
sedentary it can improve our physical and mental health.
We all know that TV binges aren’t good for our mental health, but we can halve
the negative impacts by getting up more often and moving between episodes or
A new study from the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute and international
collaborators which examined data from more than 40,000 people, shows for the
first time that breaking up sitting in our leisure time can help reduce the
risk of diabetes, heart disease, depression and anxiety.
Study co-author and Head of Physical Activity research at the Baker Institute,
Professor David Dunstan said that the mechanisms driving both physical and
“We are exploring the idea that getting up and moving more helps to reduce
inflammation in the body, which can benefit both physical and mental health,”
“Blood flow is likely to increase and your body becomes more efficient at
The study collected data from 40,550 Swedish workers between 2017 and 2019,
with participants indicating how often they typically spent sitting in their
leisure time, and the frequency with which they interrupted this. They also
Compared to those who never or rarely interrupted their sitting time, those
who reported at least some interruptions had a lower risk of experiencing
depression and anxiety symptoms. Those who indicated that they interrupted
their sitting ‘very often’ reported half the rate of depression and anxiety
The paper — published in the journal Translational Psychiatry — proposed the
best way to beat ‘bingeing blues’ was to stand up and move after every 30
“In real life, this could be as simple as just standing up from the chair or
couch, but ideally might involve simple resistance activities like half
squats, arm or back stretches, or a brief walk — even just a few steps,”
The average Australian adult spends about nine hours per day sitting, a
significant proportion of which is done during leisure time and in front of
“The changing landscape of TV consumption, with the trend towards streaming
services and away from free-to-air channels with ad breaks, also means the
average viewer has even fewer prompts to get up off the couch and a never
ending supply of content to keep them there,” Professor Dunstan said.
“Our recent work indicates sedentary behaviours like watching TV that are
passive in nature and mainly occur in leisure time are more detrimental to
mental wellbeing than mentally-active sedentary behaviours, such as reading or
activities that involve problem solving and deliberate mental effort.
“Given the high levels of depression and anxiety in the community, and how
much time the average person spends sitting down, it’s important to examine
“We also found the potential mental health benefits of interrupting sedentary
behaviour may be greater in those who are highly sedentary during leisure-
time, the people our previous research has shown are most at risk of
1. Get up during ad breaks or set reminders during streaming to introduce walking breaks or some brief exercises to get the muscles moving. A good guide is to break up sitting time every half hour.
2. Swap some mentally passive sedentary activities with more mentally active ones – try reading or playing a game, instead of just watching TV.
3. Do household tasks such as cooking, ironing or cleaning while watching TV so it isn’t always sedentary and requires some cognitive engagement.
4. Make a conscious effort to incorporate exercise into your day to break up large amounts of mentally-passive sedentary activities.
