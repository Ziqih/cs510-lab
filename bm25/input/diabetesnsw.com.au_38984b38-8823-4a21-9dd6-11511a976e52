# Weight loss key to type 2 remission
Weight loss needs to be the earliest and most important treatment for patients
living with type 2 diabetes because it can help them achieve remission.
That’s the exciting news out of the UK! The DiRECT study, funded by Diabetes
UK, has demonstrated for the first time that remission of type 2 diabetes is
possible and the long held view of diabetes being a ‘life sentence’ isn’t
The DiRECT study found that almost half of participants in the overweight or
obese range who followed an intensive low-calorie diet of around 850 calories
a day, for between 8 and 20 weeks, were able to put their type 2 diabetes into
remission. The more weight that an individual lost, the more likely it was
that they achieved remission. Nine out of 10 participants who lost 15kg or
more were able to put their diabetes in remission and come off all diabetes
medications. In a follow up 12 months later, over one third were still in
Remission in adults with type 2 diabetes means that their symptoms of diabetes
are no longer present and their blood glucose levels no longer need to be
managed with diabetes medication. Remission may not be permanent, so ongoing
The results of the DiRECT study are extremely encouraging which is why
Diabetes NSW & ACT is raising research funding for the Australian T2 Remission
Project. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate that an intensive,
supported, weight loss program can lead to the remission of type 2 diabetes.
Diabetes NSW & ACT believes that if the same results are achieved in
Australia, as in the UK, then the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the longer
term health of the country will be transformed. That’s why we want to conduct
“This ground-breaking research has major implications for Australia both for
the health of people with type 2 diabetes and the cost savings achievable, if
we can replicate this study and deliver comparable results,” said T2 Remission
If we can demonstrate success in the Australian context, it may have a lasting
influence on the direction of national health policy. Positive outcomes may
lead to a national program funded by Governments aimed at reducing the
incidence of Type 2 diabetes, and the escalating costs of diabetes health
This program provides the possibility of a life truly free of the
“If the DiRECT study is replicated in the Australian context, this can lead to
a significant paradigm shift in primary health care nationally.” Professor
