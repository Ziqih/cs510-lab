# Testosterone can help prevent type 2 diabetes
The largest investigation of testosterone treatment ever undertaken has shown
that, over and above the effect of a lifestyle program, treatment with
testosterone can prevent or trigger remission of newly diagnosed type 2
The study, known as T4DM (Testosterone for the prevention of Diabetes
Mellitus), was led by the University of Adelaide and involved six specialist
T4DM was a two-year randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
The results are published online today in _The Lancet Diabetes&
The T4DM study included more than 1000 men aged between 50 and 74 years old
All men were enrolled in the WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers) lifestyle
program. They could attend groups, use the website, the app, or any
Half of the men were injected with long-acting testosterone every three
months. The other half were injected with placebo.
After two years of treatment, 87 out of 413 (21%) men in the placebo group had
type 2 diabetes (based on an oral glucose tolerance test) compared with 55 out
of 443 (12%) men in the testosterone group.
Men in both groups lost weight (on average 3 to 4kg). Glucose tolerance
normalised in 43% and 52% of men in the placebo and testosterone groups,
Other findings at two years in men treated with testosterone compared to
* An increase in skeletal muscle mass and hand grip strength
* There were no differences in wellbeing or quality of life.
The most common adverse effect occurring in 22% of men treated with
testosterone was an increase in the concentration of red cells in the blood,
Lead researcher Professor Gary Wittert, Director of the Freemason’s Centre for
Male Health and Wellbeing, University of Adelaide, said: “The results of the
study show that, on top of modest weight loss achieved with healthy eating and
increased activity, testosterone has some added benefit to prevent or reverse
“However, the results do not necessarily mean that a script for testosterone
“We know that men at risk of type 2 diabetes are usually overweight and either
have, or are at risk of, other chronic disorders that have not been detected
“Not infrequently these men are also drinking too much alcohol and have sleep
“Weight loss achieved through healthy lifestyle behaviours remains the
More research is needed to determine whether the beneficial effects of
testosterone persist beyond two years, whether longer term treatment is safe
and whether other forms of testosterone have similar benefits or risks.
“Writing a prescription might be quick and easy but it does not replace the
need for undertaking a comprehensive assessment and providing holistic
management towards improving men’s health,” Professor Wittert said.
Professor Bu Yeap from the University of Western Australia’s Medical School,
and President of the Endocrine Society of Australia, who was one of the
researchers, said: “This is a landmark study which will prompt renewed
