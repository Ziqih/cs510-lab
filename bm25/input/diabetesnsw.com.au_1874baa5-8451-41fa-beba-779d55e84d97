1. Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Cook potatoes for 10 minutes or until just cooked. Drain and set aside.
2. Lightly grease a large non-stick frying pan with olive oil spray. Heat over medium-high heat. Season both sides of chicken breasts with pepper. Add to the pan and cook for 5 -10 minutes each side or until cooked through.
3. Turn up heat to high and pour in balsamic vinegar. Allow to slightly caramalise but not burn. Remove chicken and let sit for 5 minutes before slicing thickly across the grain. Keep juice in pan.
4. In a cup combine yoghurt, juice from pan, shallots, orange juice and zest and mix well. Season to taste.
5. In a large mixing bowl add tomatoes, peaches, cucumber, mint and potato. Add yoghurt dressing and toss. Now add salad leaves and gently fold in to avoid crushing them.
6. Divide salad amongst bowls and top with slices of chicken. (Remember, only the equivalent of 1 small potato and 150g peaches per person to stay within the carbohydrate allowance).
