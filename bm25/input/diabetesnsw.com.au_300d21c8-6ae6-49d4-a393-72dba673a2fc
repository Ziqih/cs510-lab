# Researchers find out how type 2 diabetes develops
In a new study from researchers from UCLA have discovered the process which
may explain how type 2 diabetes develops. The study helps to explain the
mechanism by which pancreatic cells secrete high levels of insulin during the
A central question in diabetes research is why cells of the pancreas, known as
beta cells, initially over-secrete insulin. The prevailing theory was that the
body may be in the process of becoming “deaf” to insulin, so beta cells
secrete more to compensate. But isolated beta cells still over-secrete
insulin, which exposes a gap in that theory.
In the new study, researchers set out to understand what other mechanism
beyond insulin resistance (that is, the body becoming “deaf” to insulin) and
high glucose levels might explain why diabetes develops. The scientists found
that a pathway independent of glucose, but sensitive to fatty acids, appears
to drive insulin secretion in the early stages of diabetes.
The research team, led by Orian Shirihai, a professor of endocrinology and
pharmacology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, used pre-diabetic
mice to study the mechanisms by which insulin may be secreted in the absence
The team found that in beta cells from obese, pre-diabetic animals, a protein
known as Cyclophilin D, or CypD, induced a phenomenon known as “proton leak,”
and that this leak promoted insulin secretion in the absence of elevated
glucose. The mechanism was dependent on fatty acids, which are normally
incapable of stimulating insulin secretion in healthy animals.
Further, obese mice who lacked the gene for CypD did not secrete excess
insulin. The team confirmed the same process was taking place in isolated
human pancreas cells: In the presence of fatty acids at levels that would be
typical in obese humans, the cells secreted insulin in the absence of elevated
The results suggest new ways to prevent the development of insulin resistance
and to treat diabetes, including halting its progression by blocking the
