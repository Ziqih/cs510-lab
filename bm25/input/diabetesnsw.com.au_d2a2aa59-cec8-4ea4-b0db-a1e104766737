Many shelf-stable foods also have a minimal effect on your blood glucose
levels, and you may even already have some in your pantry or freezer.
Here's our top 10 pantry essentials, plus dietitian-approved recipes to give

Dry goods are usually the least expensive and most versatile ingredients in
your kitchen. Flour is an essential and can be used to make homemade pizza
bases, fresh pasta or bread. Some healthy alternatives to white flour include
whole wheat, whole meal spelt, quinoa, oat or almond flour.
Dry beans like kidney beans, garbanzo, black or cannellini, as well as lentils
and legumes are a great source of protein and fibre. For people living with

Milk is a powerhouse of essential nutrients: protein, calcium, zinc,
magnesium, phosphorous as well as vitamins A, D, B2 and B12. Long life milk
can be stored in the pantry at room temperature for months before being
opened. Powdered milk has the water reduced or removed. There is little
nutrition difference. Buy the one you enjoy the most.

B6, Niacin, folate and minerals - magnesium, zinc, calcium, copper, selenium,
phosphorus and potassium. Add to breakfast cereals or meals for extra protein.
Nut butters are great alternatives for those who have difficulty chewing.
These chickpea and nut cakes make a delicious savoury meal.
Vita-weat, Ryvita, 9 grains or five super seeds are savoury crackers that are
lower in saturated fat and higher in fibre that can last in the pantry for
months. Try storing in airtight container or zip lock bags to maintain

creations. There is no expiration date for herbs and spices but a good way to
determine their potency is to give them a sniff. If you can’t smell your
spices, you most likely will not be able to taste them in your food. Spices
have a long shelf life if stored in air-tight containers away from heat and
