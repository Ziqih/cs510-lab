# Global diets change dramatically over 50 years
International food supply patterns are supporting healthier diets in parts of
the world, but causing malnutrition and obesity elsewhere.
Research carried out by the University of Kent and Imperial College London has
revealed global diets have changed dramatically over the past 50 years in
International food supply patterns are supporting healthier diets in parts of
the world, but causing malnutrition and obesity elsewhere. They are also
having important effects on environmental sustainability, with potentially
Dr James Bentham, Lecturer in Statistics at Kent’s School of Mathematics,
Statistics and Actuarial Science, led the research alongside Professor Majid
Ezzati from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London and other
The researchers carried out the study analysing food supply data for 171
The team discovered that South Korea, China and Taiwan have experienced the
largest changes in food supply over the past five decades, with animal source
foods such as meat and eggs, sugar, vegetables, seafood and oil crops all
becoming a much larger proportion of their diet.
In contrast, for many Western countries the supply of animal source foods and
sugar has declined, particularly in high-income English-speaking countries
such as the UK, US, Canada and Australia.
The researchers also found that many countries around the world have seen an
increase in vegetable-based diets. The sub-Saharan Africa region showed the
least change, with a lack of diverse food supply, and this could be an
The declines in diets based on animal source foods and sugar and corresponding
increases in vegetable availability indicate a possible trend towards more
balanced and healthier foods in some parts of the world.
##**Increased sugar intake in China linked to obesity**
However, in South Korea, China and Taiwan in particular, the increase in
animal source and sugar availability has occurred at the same time as a
dramatic rise in obesity, and also suggests that changes in diet may be having
Dr Bentham said: ‘There are clear shifts in global food supply, and these
trends may be responsible for strong improvements in nutrition in some parts
of the world. However, obesity remains a long-term concern, and we hope that
our research will open doors to analysis of the health impacts of global diet
patterns. Equally, we must also consider carefully the environmental impacts
Professor Ezzati added: ‘Advances in science and technology, together with
growing incomes, have allowed many nations to have access to a diversity of
foods. We must harness these advances and set in place policies that provide
healthier foods for people everywhere, especially those who can currently
