Diabetic retinopathy usually develops in stages. When you get your eye
screening results, you should see a letter and a number which tells you the
type of retinopathy you may have. For example, an ‘R’ stands for retinopathy

These letters and number may be different depending on where you live in the
UK, so speak to your healthcare team if you're not sure. Here are the four
This is sometimes called background retinopathy. It means your eye sight isn’t
affected yet but you need to prevent the problem getting worse. You might hear
this called R1 when you get your eye screening results.
The damage is more serious and you’ll need to get your eyes screened more
often to check for any changes. You might hear this called R2.
This means you’re now at a very high risk of losing your sight and you’ll be
offered treatment. You might hear this called R3.
This is a different type of retinopathy that affects the middle of the eye,
which may mean that you won’t be able to read or drive. You might hear this
called M0 if there's no maculopathy found in your eyes, or M1 if fluid is
starting to build-up in your eye and is affecting your sight.

retinopathy and there are lots of things you can do yourself to prevent it

### Look out for any changes to your eyesight
You might not have any symptoms of retinopathy before it starts to affect your
sight. So it's important to go to your eye screening appointments.
But some people do notice changes to their vision. These won’t be the same for
everyone, but here are some of the early signs:
* seeing floaters – these look like whispy clouds, floating in and out of your vision

Your eyesight can also go a bit blurry if your blood sugar goes higher than
usual, even for a short time. This is normal and is a symptom of high blood
sugars. Get your sugar levels back to your target level and when they’ve

Consistently high blood sugar levels make you more at risk of diabetes
Knowing what your target levels are and regularly checking your blood sugars
