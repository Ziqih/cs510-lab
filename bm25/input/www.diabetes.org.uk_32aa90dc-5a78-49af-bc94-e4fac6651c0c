>>>>>>> I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2001 when I had to go for a
routine check at the doctors and gave my blood sample. The nurse asked how
long I had been diabetic and I said ‘I don’t have diabetes’ so then I went for
a glucose test. When the results came back they said I definitely had type 2
diabetes and going by results I’d had diabetes for a long time – possibly as
>>>>>>> When I was growing up, my grandfather’s brother had type 2 diabetes
and had complications from it - he was blind. My auntie, Florence, had type 2
diabetes too. I had quite a lot of contact with it growing up so I knew what
>>>>>>> My cousin Shelia has type 2 diabetes like me and she is on insulin as
well. She is one of seven children and out of the five girls, four of them
have type 2 diabetes. We see each other often to talk about diet and exercise,
our levels and managing our diabetes. It’s good to talk with someone about it.
I was diagnosed with diabetes first but she was border line diabetic for a
>>>>>>> I was quite shocked at the time but looking back, once I knew the
symptoms of diabetes, I had been very tired. I had three children and one of
my sons is severely disabled and my daughter had a rare metabolic condition,
so I put my fatigue down to looking after them and everyday life.
>>>>>>> I’ve always done some sort of exercise, I line dance three times a
week and also do aqua aerobics. I can reach as many as 6,000 steps in one
evening when I line dance, but I have always struggled to lose weight, no
>>>>>>> I do try and eat healthy foods but I get times when I rebel a little
bit. Generally, I’m pretty good with my food but if I’m going away for the
weekend I will have a little drink or treat myself.
>>>>>>> When I first read about the One Million Step Challenge, I considered
it for a moment, then I told myself there was no way I’d be able to do that
many steps. But when I read that you could do it any way you wanted, I
realised that as long as my line dancing steps counted towards my total, then
>>>>>>> I surprised myself with how many I ended up doing - 1.5 million steps.
After I reached one million in August, I decided to carry on. In the final
fortnight of the challenge, I really pulled out the stops to get the last half
a million. I raised £1,249 which I never dreamed I’d be able to do. I’d set my
original target as £150 but the more steps I did, the more people supported
me. I line danced with my friends, but I did most of the challenge on my own.
>>>>>>> I’ve had my check up since I started doing the challenge and my HbA1c
has been the best it’s been for six years. I’d like to put my diabetes into
>>>>>>> I’d love for the money I’ve raised to go towards research into
medication. Things have come such a long way for people living with diabetes
and it would be great if they could continue getting better.

important to find someone to talk to about it.

because they have more insight into what you’re going through.
