# We’re urging parents to be aware of diabetes symptoms during the coronavirus
We’re urging parents not to let coronavirus fears stop them from seeking
medical help if they're worried their child is showing the signs and symptoms
On Wednesday 8 April, Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of
NHS England, said that the public should continue to seek emergency care
during the coronavirus lockdown period if it is needed.
In light of this, we want to remind parents to be aware of the 4Ts of type 1
diabetes, and reassure you that if your child needs urgent help during this
Type 1 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in children and young
people. But our new research has found that almost a quarter (23%) of all
newly diagnosed children and young people with type 1 diabetes in England and
Wales were not formally diagnosed until they had become seriously ill with
This analysis is based on the National Paediatric Diabetes Audit Hospital
admissions and complications reports 2012-2015 (2017). They show show that
each year around 600 children and young people received a type 1 diabetes
DKA is life threatening but, in most cases, preventable. Acting quickly can
save lives, so it’s important we continue to raise awareness about the common
early symptoms of type 1 diabetes. This will help more children be diagnosed
earlier, and reduce their risk of developing DKA.
The early signs and symptoms are easy to mistake for a viral infection or
other illness, which is why it’s so important to be aware of the 4Ts:
* Toilet - going to the toilet a lot, bed wetting by a previously dry child or heavier nappies in babies
* Thirsty - being really thirsty and not being able to quench the thirst
* Tired - feeling more tired than usual
* Thinner - losing weight or looking thinner than usual
The 4Ts are also the most common symptoms in adults, who should equally be
aware of the signs of type 1 diabetes. Other symptoms can include infections
These symptoms can come on very quickly – over a few days or weeks – and need
urgent treatment. Without it, consistently high blood sugar levels can lead to
DKA. This can often be treated with insulin and fluids if it is picked up
quickly, but the life-threatening complication could be prevented entirely if
the signs of type 1 diabetes are spotted early.
While the UK is under lockdown, we have been hearing from clinicians that
disproportionate numbers of young people are arriving for urgent care already
in DKA, highlighting the need to act fast if you suspect type 1 diabetes.
