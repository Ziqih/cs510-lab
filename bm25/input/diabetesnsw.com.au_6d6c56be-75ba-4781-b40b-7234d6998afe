# There's no such thing as a silly question
Have you had a question about your diabetes but felt it might be too silly to
Living with diabetes is a complex business. We would all agree that it often
requires more than just tablet/s or insulin to self-manage.
Whether you are newly diagnosed or have been living with diabetes for some
time, it takes great dedication and patience to manage diabetes on a day to
If you are newly diagnosed, it is not uncommon to feel a bit lost and unsure
where to begin. Sometimes not knowing what questions to ask can be a barrier
For those who might have a bit more experience in their self-management
journey, learning to cope with the regular commitments of glucose monitoring
and overall lifestyle changes can sometimes lead to diabetes burnout – a point
when the daily grind gets you down. This, along with the convenience of
internet access just a fingertip away, can also mean endless newfound trends
or diets that promise to help with your diabetes to consider and question.
Diabetes management has definitely come a long way in recent years, from more
medication options to advances in home glucose monitoring. But while diabetes
has become more manageable, it isn’t necessarily easier. However, you do not
have to do this alone. Asking for help is an important step towards getting
the professional support you need, and we are here to help you.
We provide many diabetes education workshops and events and we also have a
dedicated helpline service just for you. It is staffed by health professionals
from 9am – 4pm Monday to Friday, answering your questions.
We hear a broad range of questions, including:
* How often should I check my glucose level?
* What do I need to be aware of when I’m travelling?
* Which other health professionals should I see and how do I get access to them?
* My blood glucose levels are high and I’m not sure why or what I could do?
Remember, there is no such thing as a silly question. All questions have merit
So don’t think twice when that question pops up in your head. Give us a call
on **1300 342 238** and one of our friendly health professionals will happily
speak with you. You can also give us a call on this number if you would like
to find out more about our programs, book in for an event or even update your
