>>>>>>> # Earlier identification of people with type 2 diabetes (our position)
>>>>>>> The sooner that type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the better. This can
help reduce the risk of a person going on to develop devastating
complications. Early identification can also spot people at increased risk of
developing type 2 diabetes and help them delay or prevent the condition.
>>>>>>> * We support the recommendations of the UK Expert Committee
that those with an HbA1c of 42-47mmol/mol (6.0-6.4%) should be considered high
>>>>>>> * We currently use the term “at high risk of type 2
diabetes” for those with Non-diabetic Hyperglycaemia. Although the term
'prediabetes' has become more common in the lay press, in general we won’t use
that term because of the lack of clarity over what is meant by it.
>>>>>>> * We support NICE public health guidance 38 but also
recommend that there needs to be a systematic approach to identifying people
with type 2 diabetes early, which identifies and targets high risk groups no
matter where someone lives in the UK. The various prevention programmes
designed to tackle type 2 diabetes in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland
are crucial in identifying these groups early. It is important that this is
rolled out across the entirety of the UK. Therefore Diabetes UK and Diabetes
UK Cymru also recommend the development of a prevention programme for Wales.
