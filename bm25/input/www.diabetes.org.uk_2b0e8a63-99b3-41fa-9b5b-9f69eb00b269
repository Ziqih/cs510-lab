Parents are being encouraged to sign up for a free app which tells them the
sugar content of food and drink. The new 'Sugar Smart' app from Public Health
England works by scanning the barcode of products to show the total sugar
content in cubes or grams, aiming to help parents take control of their
## The threat to health of being overweight or obese
A fifth of 4–5 year olds and a third of 10–11 year olds are overweight or
obese. Consuming too much sugar can lead to painful tooth decay, weight gain
and obesity. This can also affect children’s wellbeing making them more likely
to be bullied, have low self-esteem and miss school. Being overweight as a
child also increases the chance of the individual being overweight as an
adult, putting them at risk of serious health problems including Type 2
diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.Dr Alison Tedstone, Chief
Nutritionist for Public Health England, explained: “Children aged five
shouldn’t have more than 19 grams of sugar per day – that’s five cubes, but
it’s very easy to have more. That’s why we want parents to be “Sugar
Smart”.”As the ‘Sugar Smart’ app launches, Diabetes UK is highlighting the
urgent need for the Government to put a number of measures in place to help
Chris Askew, Diabetes UK Chief Executive, said: “Diets that are high in sugar
are fuelling the rise in obesity, and in turn the dramatic rise in Type 2
diabetes, a serious health condition that can lead to devastating
complications such as blindness, amputations and stroke. This is unlike Type 1
diabetes which cannot be prevented and is not caused by being obese. With the
average child consuming three times the recommended daily amount of sugar, the
need for action has never been more urgent. The new Sugar Smart app will help
parents to understand and take control of their children’s sugar intake.
“However, the app alone is not enough to achieve the reduction in sugar intake
we need to see across the population. We need to see the Government act on
recommendations made by Public Health England, including restricting marketing
of unhealthy foods to children, reducing and rebalancing the number of price
promotions offered on unhealthy foods, implementing a clear and transparent
programme for reformulating unhealthy foods and reducing portion sizes. It
must also introduce a sugar tax on soft drinks to reduce consumption. People
also need to be supported to undertake regular physical activity and supported
to choose healthier foods, including through a clear and consistent food
labelling system.“Until we get better at helping people to live healthy and
active lives by taking a number of necessary measures, the rise in obesity
will continue to see cases of Type 2 diabetes soar at an alarming rate,
costing not only human lives but also crippling the already overstretched
