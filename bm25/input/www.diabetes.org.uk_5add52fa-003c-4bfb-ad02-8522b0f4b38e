>>>>>>> # Research spotlight – retraining the immune system to fight Type 1
>>>>>>> ### If you have Type 1 diabetes, your immune system has attacked the
insulin-producing beta cells in your pancreas. This means you can’t make
enough of your own insulin, and need to replace it through injections or a
>>>>>>> But insulin doesn't treat the underlying cause of Type 1 diabetes: an
immune system attack. This is what new treatments – called immunotherapies –
will be able to do, by reprogramming the immune system so that it no longer
destroys beta cells. In the future, they could stop Type 1 diabetes in its
>>>>>>> ## The nuts and bolts of immunotherapy
>>>>>>> Our immune system is normally made up of a balance of different types
of immune cells, all working together to protect us against infections. But in
Type 1 diabetes the immune system thinks insulin-producing beta cells are the
>>>>>>> ### In Type 1 diabetes there are three types of immune cells at work:
>>>>>>>> **‘Killer’ T cells: the assassins of the immune system.**
>>>>>>>> They recognise and destroy harmful bacteria and viruses. But in Type
>>>>>>>> **Regulatory T cells, or Tregs: the police of the immune system.**
>>>>>>>> They call law and order by keeping killer T cells incheck. In Type 1,
Tregs become outnumbered and can no longer turn off the killer T cells when
they’re not needed. This means killer T cells are free to invade the pancreas
>>>>>>>> B cells make proteins called antibodies. Antibodies stick to the
surface of harmful germs to alert killer T cells to the presence of intruders.
But in Type 1, B cells produce a type of antibody which recognises parts of
our own body instead of germs, called autoantibodies.
>>>>>>> Autoantibodies bind to beta cells, signalling that this cell needs to
be destroyed. They can appear years – sometimes decades – before you’re
diagnosed with Type 1 and they’re a sign that the immune attack is in motion.
Because of this, we can test for autoantibodies to predict if someone will
>>>>>>> Different immunotherapies work in different ways, but they all aim to
stop the immune system from attacking the pancreas. Some try to teach the B
cells to no longer see beta cells as their enemy. Others try to dampen down
the activity of B cells or killer T cells, so they can’t play their role. And
some treatments help the Treg police to protect the pancreas against an
>>>>>>> Scientists believe immunotherapies could help people with Type 1
>>>>>>> We can find people who have a high risk of Type 1 diabetes by looking
at their genes or testing to see if they have autoantibodies in their blood.
Immunotherapies could be given to those at risk before any of their beta cells
have been destroyed, to try and stop Type 1 diabetes from developing, or at
>>>>>>> When people have just been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes the immune
system hasn’t quite finished its attack, meaning that up to 20% of your beta
cells are still alive. Immunotherapies could be used when someone is first
diagnosed to preserve these beta cells. And the more beta cells we can
protect, the more insulin you can produce on your own. This could make blood
sugar control easier and protect you against serious complications down the
>>>>>>> Immunotherapies could potentially help people already living with Type
1 diabetes. Scientists are looking for ways to replace or regenerate the beta
cells that have been destroyed. Once we can do this, immunotherapies could be
used alongside the beta cell therapy to protect these new cells from another
>>>>>>> ## What stage is the research at?
>>>>>>> Before any new treatments can be given outside of a research setting
they have to be rigorously tested in clinical trials. Scientists are doing
this with different immunotherapies right now. The majority of trials are
involving people who are within 100 days of their diagnosis. But trials are
also happening in people who don’t yet have Type 1 diabetes, but are at a high
>>>>>>> As a next step, we need further, larger clinical trials. The results
then need to be put to regulatory bodies – who decide whether a new treatment
is safe and effective – and grant it a licence. Only once an immunotherapy has
>>>>>>> ## What we're doing to get us there sooner
>>>>>>> We set up the Type 1 diabetes Immunotherapy Consortium in 2015, with
an investment of £2.8 million and co-funding from JDRF. Its goal is to bring
scientists together to speed up the clinical trial process and make the first
immunotherapy available to people with Type 1 diabetes as soon as possible.

immune system in people with Type 1 diabetes, so scientists can find new and
