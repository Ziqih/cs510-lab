My husband, also underwent surgery, lost 35kgs and his type 2 diabetes has
gone into remission. We’ve made significant changes to our family’s lifestyle.
We always cook at home, use fresh produce and even when we’re both busy we
still don’t reach for a takeaway. We keep leftovers in the freezer so we know
there is always something good to eat. We don’t call it a diet. It’s actually
our lifestyle that’s changed. They are small changes but they make a big
