# Even small improvements in blood glucose levels can result in huge benefits
Sanofi, Diabetes UK and JDRF today announce the publication of IMPACT 2 in the
journal Diabetic Medicine. This new study shows that, if sustained, even
modest improvement in blood glucose levels can provide significantly improved
outcomes for the 3.5 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK. As a
result, if applied to the whole diabetes population, almost a million serious
medical complications, such as blindness, amputation and kidney failure could
be avoided over 25 years, improving the lives of people with diabetes.Better
management of blood glucose levels over the same period could equate to a cost
avoidance of £5.5 billion for the NHS.IMPACT 2 is a study based on data and
population modelling. It is the outcome of a collaboration between Diabetes
UK, JDRF and Sanofi, and the analysis was completed by IMS and the York Health
Economics Consortium. It quantifies the patient and financial benefit over 25
years of earlier intervention for better controlling blood glucose. The
findings highlight results that could have a significant impact for people
• For people with Type 2 diabetes the figure of potentially preventable
complications is 870,000 equating to a cost avoidance of £4.5 billion over 25
• For people with Type 1 diabetes the figure of potentially preventable
complications is 88,000 equating to a cost avoidance of just under £1 billion
## Even small improvements in blood glucose levels can result in huge benefits
Chris Askew, Diabetes UK Chief Executive commented, “IMPACT 2 demonstrates
that even small improvements in blood glucose levels can result in huge
benefits for people with diabetes with the potential to stop 23,000 people
suffering severe kidney failure, almost 160,000 leg ulcers and amputations and
over 50,000 people suffering severe loss of vision. This should be a priority
for all those involved in providing care for people with diabetes.” He
continued, “Preventing Type 2 diabetes through public health initiatives is of
course the best way of reducing spend long-term, however much greater efforts
are needed to ensure all people with diabetes get the support and care they
need for a good quality of life and better health outcomes.”
Karen Addington, Chief Executive of JDRF in the UK, agreed, adding, “People
with Type 1 diabetes are routinely still receiving poorer care and are less
likely to be meeting NICE recommended blood glucose targets, when compared to
people with Type 2 diabetes. The IMPACT 2 results show the benefit to people
living with Type 1 diabetes and the NHS in providing appropriate care, support
and education to help people manage their condition.”
The report is published against a backdrop of blood glucose management in the
UK being amongst the worst in Europe and around two thirds of all people with
diabetes in England not achieving the treatment targets recommended by
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). In addition, despite
well-documented benefits of reducing complications through timely control of
blood glucose, levels are too high before additional interventions are
provided. On average, people in the UK with Type 2 diabetes have the highest
blood glucose levels (HbA1c 9.8 per cent) when compared to nine other
developed countries, at the point of insulin initiation.
“The scale of the findings have important implications for clinical practice
in the NHS. In a cost constrained healthcare system, interventions, medical or
otherwise, will always be required to justify any improvement in patient
outcome against cost. For the first time clinicians have clear evidence of the
reduction in spending that could be conferred by reducing serious diabetes
related complications through better blood glucose control,” says Professor
Steve Bain, Professor in Medicine (Diabetes), University of Swansea.
## NHS spend on diabetes is on the increase
NHS spend on diabetes is already considerable and on the increase. IMPACT 1
showed that diabetes costs the NHS £10 billion each year – around £1 million
an hour – which is about 10 per cent of the entire NHS budget. Nearly 80 per
cent of these costs are attributable to treating avoidable complications,
which could potentially be reduced through better management of diabetes,
including improved blood glucose control. Diabetes is now the leading
preventable cause of sight loss in people of working age in the UK and 135
amputations are carried out every week as a result of poor management of the
“Diabetes is a major healthcare problem with a large and increasing number of
people in the UK suffering from avoidable microvascular complications such as
kidney disease and foot amputations because their blood glucose levels are too
high. IMPACT 2 quantifies the reduction in the number of complications, and
the potential cost avoidance if modest improvements to patients’ blood glucose
levels were made. There is the potential to generate real improvements in
outcomes for patients with diabetes by making even small but sustained
improvements in their blood glucose levels,” explains Dr Mike Baxter,
Consultant Advisor to Sanofi Diabetes and lead author of the study.
