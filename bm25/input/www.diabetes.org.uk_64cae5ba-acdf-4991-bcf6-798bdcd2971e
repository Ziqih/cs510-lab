Ultimately, it is a personal choice whether or not to fast. However, if you do
choose to fast, then you must consult your doctor or healthcare team before
Ramadan, to make sure that you are able to look after yourself properly.
Failing to do so is in itself contrary to the Qur'an, which clearly states
that you must not act in a way that harms your body (Al Baqarah Verse: 195).

Eid is a major occasion and celebrations involve lots of food which can be a
challenge for people with diabetes, but having diabetes doesn’t mean you can't

slowly, such as basmati rice, chickpeas and dhal or biryani. These types of
foods, and fruits and vegetables, can help keep blood glucose levels more
stable during the celebrations. If you usually check your blood sugar levels,
don’t forget to check them more often during the festivities to make sure they
