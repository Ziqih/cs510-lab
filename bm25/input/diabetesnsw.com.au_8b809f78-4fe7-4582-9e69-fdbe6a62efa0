... Limiting stress and boredom-induced eating during home isolation
# Limiting stress and boredom-induced eating during home isolation
We’ve all been there. Standing in front of the fridge or pantry staring at the
First off, you are not alone. Many of us are eating too much, and it’s a well-
Often, we’re not really hungry. We may have eaten not long ago but here we are
again looking to satisfy and soothe the senses, feelings or emotions; seeking
the smell, sight, taste, texture and comfort of food.
Because food can be a quick, easy and enjoyable way to pass time. Maybe it’s a
filler when you’re looking to fill the dullness that boredom or unwanted
Essentially boredom or stress-induced eating is a type of ‘non-hungry’ eating
Food can bring great comfort and perhaps has done so since the day we were
born. Look at the way babies feed: Food and comfort in one armful.
Seeking comfort from food is not a problem in itself, if it’s just one of many
However, if it’s the only or main management strategy, it can lead to problems
of its own. And this can affect your diabetes management, and overall physical
The social distancing and home isolation measures we’re enduring because of
the Covid-19 pandemic make it very challenging to limit boredom or stress-
induced eating. Even for the most motivated individuals.
Staying at home means there is unlimited access to your fridge and pantry.
Combine this with having less, or more, to do or worry about - such as whether
you’ll still have a job tomorrow – and it’s obvious why we’re seeking comfort.
With no appointments to attend, no physical social gatherings, no fitness or
education classes to go to, there is less to occupy us. Loneliness, concerns
about food and essential provisions, and the NEW shopping experience itself
with hand sanitizers and social distancing can also play on our minds.
Concerns about your finances, the virus itself, worry about those you love,
and fears about your own health may well be occupying your thoughts.
It’s no wonder some of us seek the instant comfort that food brings.
In a nutshell, food makes us feel good.
Eating prompts the brain to release 'feel good' hormones, known as endorphins,
which can produce a sense of pleasure or euphoria. In general, few of us enjoy
the monotony that boredom or the lack of comfort that stress brings. Food can
be a satisfying go-to when life gets too much.
##**How could boredom and/or stress-induced eating affect your diabetes
In the short-term, non-hungry eating may lead to higher blood glucose levels
(BGLs). If you are eating more food than you need physically, you will require
more insulin to keep your BGLs within a safe range.
In the long term, non-hungry eating (and stress for that matter) can lead to
BGL elevations, and for some, weight gain. Continuous higher than safe BGLs,
(for example, higher than 10mmol/L two hours after the start of a main meal),
can lead to blood vessel damage, which is largely how diabetes complications
##**Strategies to minimise boredom and or stress-induced eating during
1. ###**Plan what you are going to eat each day and roughly when**
A typical daily eating plan includes three main meals and one to three small
healthier snacks, spread evenly over the day. Have an idea of what you’re
going to eat at these meals. Check in with how hungry you are (see point 5
below), especially if you’re not as active as usual, and make changes to
See the Healthy Meal Ideas and Healthy Snacks factsheets for inspiration.
The 4Ds is a method used to reduce urges when quitting smoking: however, it
can be applied in a similar way to reduce the urge to eat when you’re not
The 4Ds are: Delay, Deep Breathing, Distract, and Drink Water.
 **Delay** : Delay the start of eating, eg, ask yourself to wait five to 10
minutes. By then, the urge may have moved on.
 **Deep breathing** : When you feel the urge to go to the pantry, take 10 deep
 **Distract:** Find another support or something else to do eg, go for a walk
outside, hang out the washing, call a friend, read a book.
 **Drink water:** Have a hydrating glass of water before you eat.
3. ###**Avoid eating in front of a screen**
If you’re eating in front of the TV (or computer, or smartphone, for that
matter), chances are you’re paying more attention to what’s happening on the
screen rather than to the food you’re putting in your mouth. We tend to eat
more mindlessly in front of the TV, meaning we pay less attention to the act
of nourishing our bodies with food and don’t taste and experience the food as
much because we are distracted. This not only makes food less satisfying, but
it makes it easier to miss cues that you have eaten enough, such as feeling
4. ###**Keep nutritious foods front and centre and limit nutrient-poor foods for a stronger body and mind**
Aim for the food you see first when you open the fridge or cupboard to be
healthy options such as fresh fruit, vegetables, wholegrain crackers, yoghurt
and unsalted nuts. It can help to keep some pre-prepared cut up fruit and
vegetables in the fridge so that when you want a snack, the healthy option is
Biscuits, lollies, chocolate, chips, ice-creams and other high-energy,
nutrient-poor highly processed foods can become the ‘easy option’ because they
take little preparation. They’re so easy that you may find yourself eating
some while still staring into the fridge or pantry thinking about what to eat.
To reduce the intake of these foods (which if eaten too much can weaken your
body), it might be helpful to have them out of sight, or even buy less of
A hunger scale can help you learn how to tell the difference between physical
hunger and ‘non-hungry’ (psychological) hunger that is perhaps more about
emotional support needs or boredom. Psychological hunger can be a desire to
eat caused by thoughts, a situation, emotions - such as stress, boredom,
sadness, or happiness. When you feel hungry even though you recently ate,
check to see if what you're feeling is really a hunger brought on by something
When you start feeling like you want something to eat, try rating your hunger
on a scale of one to 10, with one being starving and 10 being so full you feel
sick. A rating of five or six means you're comfortable, neither too hungry nor
too full. It’s best to eat when your hunger is at a three or four; and to stop
6. ###**Become familiar with your boredom or stress cues**
Once you start tuning into true, physical hunger it will become easier to
identify your boredom or stress-induced ‘wanting to eat’ cues, and the times
that you are engaging in boredom or stress-induced eating. For example, is it
when you’re doing particular work tasks, is it while you prepare dinner or
when watching TV in the evening, or when you are tired and don’t feel like you
can stop and rest. If you can identify when it happens, then you can question
it next time it happens and perhaps use another support instead, such as
having a rest, doing some stretches, taking a wander outside or calling a
7. ###**Keeping your hands and mind filled with other things**
Keeping your hands busy is a great way to move your thoughts away from non-
hungry eating and to stay in the moment. Activities such as gardening, playing
with your pet, knitting, crafts, reading a book or magazine, listening to
music or a podcast, meditation, squeezing a stress ball, doing Theraband
exercises, playing cards or a board game and doing things around the house

8. ###**Avoid panic buying more food than you need**
It can be tempting to stock up or panic buy more than usual during these
extraordinary times. Having more food than usual in the house can be
problematic for some people, particularly if cupboards are full of high
Aim to keep your pantry stocked with nutritious shelf stable foods like
legumes, wholegrain pasta, lower glycaemic index (GI) rice, quinoa, oats,
canned fish, high fibre cereals, canned fruits and vegetables, wholegrain
crispbreads and crackers. Freeze wholegrain breads, lean meat, chicken and
seafood; and frozen fruit options (eg bananas, berries) that are great in
Remember that there's no need to buy out the stock at your local grocery
store. There's no indication from food retailers that there are supply issues.
It's also important to consider the needs of others and not overbuy.
