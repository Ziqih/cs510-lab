The fundraising regulator aims to ensure that fundraising is respectful, open,
## The role of the regulator is to:
* Set and promote the standards for fundraising practice (‘the code’ and associated rulebooks) in consultation with the public, fundraising stakeholders and legislators.
* Investigate cases where fundraising practices have led to significant public concern.
* Adjudicate complaints from the public about fundraising practice, where these cannot be resolved by the charities themselves.
* Operate a fundraising preference service to enable individuals to manage their contact with charities.
* Where poor fundraising practice is judged to have taken place, recommend best practice guidance and take proportionate remedial action.
* We do all we can to ensure that fundraisers, volunteers and fundraising contractors working with us to raise funds comply with the Codes and with this Promise.
* We comply with the law including those that apply to data protection, health and safety and the environment.
* We tell the truth and do not exaggerate.
* We do what we say we are going to.
* We answer all reasonable questions about our fundraising activities and costs.
Please contact us if you require further details.
* We are clear about who we are, what we do and how your gift is used.
* Where we have a promotional agreement with a commercial company, we make clear how much of the purchase price we receive.
* We give a clear explanation of how you can make a gift and amend a regular commitment.
* We respect the rights, dignities and privacy of our supporters and beneficiaries.
* We will not put undue pressure on you to make a gift and if you do not want to give or wish to cease giving, we will respect your decision.
