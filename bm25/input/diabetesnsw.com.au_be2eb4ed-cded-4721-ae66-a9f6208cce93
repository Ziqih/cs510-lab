I feel passionate about promoting diabetes awareness because it’s a chronic
disease that affects young and old Australians and there is huge
misunderstandings about how we are diagnosed and why it exists.
I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 9 years old in 1992. I don’t
remember the date, but it was at Christmas time because I remember the
decorations around the children’s hospital wards. My brother who is five years
older than I am was also diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, he was only 7 and my
parents had just migrated from Chile leaving them with little support at the
Living with diabetes has been challenging over the years, especially with the
transition from being a teenager to becoming an adult. I have witnessed many
people tell my mum “Oh, it’s easy – it’s manageable” – if only they were able
to walk a day in my shoes. Diabetes is 24 hours. Seven days a week. No break.
No holiday. It is something you are constantly thinking about, from the minute
you wake up to the moment you lay down to sleep and the hours in between. But
it should never stop you from doing anything.
I am now 30 years old and I spent the last five years living in China and
South Korea with my partner. I am healthy and thankfully don’t have
complications. I want to be a mentor for teens and young adults and offer my
support to help them live their lives to the fullest.
