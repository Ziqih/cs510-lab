#### A message from Head of Volunteering, Andy Broomhead
At Diabetes UK and within volunteering, we’re looking to the start of this new
decade with a lot of excitement and anticipation at the opportunities that lay
This year is the start of an important new period for Diabetes UK as we begin
work on our ambitious new strategy where we want to increase the number of
people with type 2 diabetes in remission, reduce the number of people being
diagnosed with type 2 and gestational diabetes, improving the quality of care
people need to manage their diabetes, increase the number of people
benefitting from new treatments and technology and help more people to live
better and more confident lives with diabetes, free from discrimination.
But we can’t do this without you. Volunteers and local groups are vital in
reaching people across the UK and it’s only by continuing to work together
will we be able to reach these ambitious aims. I’ll be sharing more over the
coming months about the different ways volunteers will be able to get more
involved in this work, but in the meantime I’d encourage you to have a look at
the strategy and speak to your local volunteering team if you’d like to know
We’ve also got a lot of other exciting work planned for 2020. As we move into
the second year of our Volunteer Strategy we’ll be looking back at what we did
throughout 2019 and sharing more about what we’ll be doing to fulfil our
promises for our 2020 plans too. We’ll also take a look at some of the
volunteering highlights from last year and show how the tireless effort you
give is making a difference to people affected by diabetes across the country.
Our Inspire Award nominations are open until Friday 6 March so if there’s a
volunteer or local group you think should be recognised then get nominating!
We’re already looking forward to both Volunteers’ Week and Diabetes Week at
the beginning of June and we’ll be continuing to share stories of your

Lastly, those people new to volunteering at Diabetes UK told us that their
first contact with us, their training and induction were all positive
experiences. In relation to training, 89% of volunteers who have been with us
for over 12 months told us that initiatives about GDPR and Safeguarding meant
they were clear about how these applied to their role.
We’re already working on making more information and training available at a
time that suits you, with the development of an online training site. We’ll
