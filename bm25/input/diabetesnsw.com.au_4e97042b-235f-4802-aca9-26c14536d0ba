# Protect beta cells to slow type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes occurs when a person's own immune system destroys insulin-
producing beta cells in the pancreas. In recent years, scientists have learned
how to grow large volumes of replacement beta cells, but they are still trying
to work out how to protect these cells against the immune attack.
Joslin Diabetes Center researchers may have found an unusual strategy to
protect transplanted beta cells to slow the onset of type 1 diabetes.
“Research in mouse models and in human cells has shown that targeting a
protein called renalase may protect beta cells against autoimmune attack by
strengthening them against stress.” says Stephan Kissler, associate professor
of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and co-senior author on a paper with
The Joslin study joins a growing set of evidence suggesting that functional
problems with beta cells themselves may help to trigger the autoimmune attack
"You might have genes that make the beta cell a little bit dysfunctional and
more prone to becoming a target of the immune system," Kissler explains.
The research began with a casual hallway conversation between Kissler and Yi
about potential ways to protect beta cells from autoimmune attack. The two
ended up launching a bold gamble to try inhibiting genes across the genome,
one at a time, using a screening technique based on the CRISPR gene-editing
method with a beta cell line from a "non-obese diabetic" (NOD) mouse that
"Whole genome CRISPR screening is a powerful tool for new target discovery and
we hoped that it would help us find any mutations that protect the beta cell,"
The CRISPR screen for surviving beta cells produced a dozen genes of interest.
The most striking was the gene for renalase, which previous research had shown
Next, the researchers created NOD mouse beta cells, some with the renalase
gene functionally "knocked out" and some not. They transplanted these cells to
Intact beta cells died off-but the renalase knock-out cells survived.
This was a very black-and-white research model. If the cells aren't protected,
The investigators then looked to see if the cells that lacked the renalase
gene provoked a diminished response from T immune cells (which spearhead the
autoimmune assault) in a dish. The scientists found that one type of T cell
was less likely to attack these knockout cells than to attack normal beta
In earlier work to analyze beta cell survival, Yi had analyzed how the cells
respond to a condition called endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Now when the
team tried three ways of introducing ER stress to mouse beta cells in a dish,
the researchers saw that the renalase mutation was protecting against this
In the next step, to see if the same mechanisms were at work in human cells,
the team joined up with Douglas Melton of the Harvard department of Stem Cell
and Regenerative Biology to create human beta cells for similar tests in a
dish. "Again, we saw that the renalase knockout protected cells against ER
The functions of renalase are not well understood, but Yi and Kissler knew
that the protein is an enzyme (which often can be targeted by drug compounds)
and that other scientists had produced a three-dimensional crystal structural
Wondering if this map would give clues to uncover a compound that could target
renalase, the Joslin investigators began working with Celia Schiffer of the
University of Massachusetts Medical School. Structural biologists at the
university's structure-based drug design core facility soon noticed that
renalase is very similar to another enzyme that is inhibited by existing
drugs-including one drug known as pargyline that was approved by the Food &
Drug Administration almost 60 years ago to treat hypertension.
Testing pargyline in their mouse transplant model, the Joslin researchers
found that the drug protected beta cells extremely well, says Kissler.
Studying it in the mouse beta cells themselves, the scientists demonstrated
that pargyline indeed was protecting against ER stress. In experiments with
human cells, pargyline also displayed a protective effect.
Kissler and Yi hope to test pargyline in a pilot clinical trial to see if it
slows the progress of new onset type 1 diabetes in a small number of patients.
"Since it's FDA-approved and the drug is safe, this would be the best approach
to test if the protection we observed in mice and human cells will hold true
If research results continue to be positive, their next goal will be to find
industry backing to develop a small molecule drug that provides even better
