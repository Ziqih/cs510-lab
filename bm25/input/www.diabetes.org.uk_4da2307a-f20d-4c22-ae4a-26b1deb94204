>>>>>>> **"The great enemy of communication, we find, is the illusion of it."
>>>>>>> Arguably, the fundamental skills in any healthcare consultation are
communication and engagement. These are essential tools that healthcare
professionals use every day – to gather information, establish the
problem/diagnosis, discuss options, and agree on an action plan. These skills
are relevant no matter whether the issue is physical or emotional.
>>>>>>> The most obvious reason for being attentive to emotions and mental
health is to recognise the person’s need for support. This is true in relation
to general psychological distress, such as depression and anxiety, but also to
the emotional impact of living with diabetes. Having a conversation about how
diabetes impacts on the person’s emotional health can help them to feel that
someone understands their perspective and is ‘on their side’. For example,
they may no longer feel isolated by feelings of guilt and frustration about
getting ‘off-track’ with their diabetes management. This change can be very
powerful because the way a person feels about their diabetes can have a
significant impact on their motivation and ability to manage it.
>>>>>>> **"Patients have their agenda… [and if that’s]… not dealt with they
cannot move on. Anything I say or recommend will not be taken in if the
patient’s issues are not dealt with first." - Practice nurse**
>>>>>>> Healthcare professionals can assist people with diabetes to develop or
strengthen their skills and confidence for effective self-management – but
first a conversation is needed to establish what challenges the person is
facing, and how to assist the person to overcome them. However, this
conversation is not (yet) part of routine practice.
>>>>>>> Numerous studies demonstrate that people with diabetes want support
with the psychosocial aspects of diabetes. Yet, distress related to living
with diabetes is not often acknowledged by healthcare professionals. While
half of health professionals report asking their patients with diabetes about
emotional issues only one quarter of people with diabetes report that a
healthcare professional has asked such questions of them. Why might this be
>>>>>>> Perhaps the person with diabetes is not expecting emotional issues to
be discussed during a consultation. Or, perhaps, healthcare professionals are
not asking the right questions, or not allowing time for the person to offer a
considered response that actually reflects how they feel about living with
>>>>>>> Seeking to understand the individual’s priorities, preferences, and
everyday challenges will enable you, together with the person, to establish a
management plan that is achievable and reflects their life or well-being.
Indeed, having the conversation may help you realise that the person needs
more help than you can provide – for example, from a diabetes educator,
>>>>>>> To achieve this, using an open, empathic communication style (see Box
1.1) can create a safe and supportive environment, build rapport, and engage
>>>>>>> **"Communication is a skill that you can learn. It’s like riding a
bicycle or typing. If you’re willing to work at it, you can rapidly improve
the quality of every part of your life." - Brian Tracy**
>>>>>>> As a healthcare professional, you bring considerable experience and a
certain perspective to your consultations. So, too, does each person with
diabetes – they bring their life experience and their awareness of how
diabetes does or doesn’t fit into their life.
>>>>>>> Having a conversation about the emotional aspects of living with
diabetes can be challenging. Many of the general techniques for effective
communication (see Box 1.2) are applicable but, like any other skill, they are
not necessarily intuitive. Communication skills take time and practice to
develop, and they can always be improved. Take this opportunity to reflect on
how you incorporate these general techniques into your consultations.
>>>>>>>> ## **Box 1.1: Open and closed communication styles**
>>>>>>>> People with diabetes seek out healthcare professionals as much for
their personal communication skills and consultation style (e.g. care and
>>>>>>>> As demonstrated in the table below, the immediate outcome of **open,
empathic communication** is an honest exchange of ideas and challenges.
Indeed, this may be the only tangible effect that the healthcare professional
is aware of – but it is likely to lead to other benefits.
>>>>>>>> In contrast, the immediate outcome of **closed, directive
communication** is a stereotypically brief consultation in which the person
with diabetes leaves with a prescription, some pamphlets or a referral. At
face value, this may appear both effective and efficient. However, the person
may have queries and concerns, which matter to them and they could not raise;
they may leave the consultation with misunderstandings and mistrust.
Importantly, they may also feel that they have not been ‘heard’.
>>>>>>>> Other potential consequences of these distinctly different
communication styles are summarised below. In the longer term, these can
translate into consequences for health (and healthcare costs), as well as
>>>>>>>> Outcomes of open, empathic communication | **Outcomes of closed,

(reflecting) as a question can help to prompt further detail. Doing this with
a deliberate pause and invitation to say more can encourage them to continue
their conversation. For example, ‘You said it has been very hard to […]?’.
>>>>>>>> * Paraphrasing means capturing the meaning in your own
words: place the onus of understanding on yourself. For example, ‘So I can be
sure I’ve got this right, you are saying that […]. Is that right?’.
>>>>>>>> * Similarly, encourage the person to ask you questions, and
check their understanding by asking them to paraphrase what you have just
said. For example, ‘I want to check that I’ve explained this clearly, so can
you please tell me in your own words …’. If your message has not been
understood, explain it again in a different way.
>>>>>>>> * Repeat key information (in different ways, if necessary).
>>>>>>>> * Most people with diabetes want someone on their side,
someone who can help and support their self-management efforts, rather than
someone who tells them what to do or criticises them.
>>>>>>>> * Use motivational, collaborative language to appreciate
the efforts the person makes and gain their confidence. For example, ‘I can
see how hard you have been working on your [blood glucose/activity

person with diabetes should be talking as much as (if not more than) you.

>>>>>>>> * Provide information in writing that is appropriate to the
audience – use plain English, bullet points, and short sentences, and consider
>>>>>>>> * Use diagrams, pictures, or models, where appropriate.
>>>>>>>> * Anecdotes and storytelling can be useful for explaining
difficult concepts. Or, you may have visual aids, or culturally appropriate or
translated resources, that you can use to improve the explanation.
>>>>>>>> * Ensure the person has ample opportunity to tell you how
they feel about your advice/the action plan, and how realistic it is for them.
For example, ‘We talked about doing blood glucose checks before every meal.
How do you feel about giving this a try in the next few weeks?’.
>>>>>>>> * Also, ask for feedback about your service. This can be
done routinely and anonymously. It will be enlightening.
>>>>>>>> * Set up expectations at the start of the consultation
(e.g. how much time is available, what will happen at the end/and next time).
>>>>>>>> * Let the person know (by signposting) that you need to
move onto another issue or to draw the consultation to a close.

or irrelevant. If the issue they are concerned about needs further discussion,

emotions. Similarly, it can be difficult to know what to say when someone
expresses their distress or shares that they are not coping well with their
>>>>>>> You can help by asking **open-ended questions** , which enable the
person to respond by describing their experience, thoughts, or feelings about
a particular issue, rather than with simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers. Creating an
empathic and supportive environment will be conducive to having conversations
>>>>>>> Begin the conversation with an opening comment to build **trust and
rapport** (e.g. normalising statement, or referring to a previous

together to get your diabetes management on track. How has this been for you?
Is there anything you’ve found particularly challenging that you’d like to
>>>>>>> Ask **open-ended questions** , to show the person that you are
interested in their experiences. Open-ended questions allow for longer
responses and more detail, they require more than just a brief/one-word
response (e.g. ‘yes’, ‘no’, or ‘OK’). For example:
>>>>>>> * ‘Tell me, how are you getting on with [aspect of diabetes
>>>>>>> * ‘You’ve been [using medication] for about
>>>>>>> * [a month now], tell me how that has been going.’
>>>>>>> * ‘You’ve had diabetes for [a year] now, what has been most
>>>>>>> * ‘What thoughts do you have about why that keeps
>>>>>>> * ‘How does that make you feel?’
>>>>>>> **Normalise the issues** raised by the person, by helping them to view
their experience as common, ‘natural’ or ‘human’. Normalising helps:
>>>>>>> * the person to disclose an experience, thought, or feeling
>>>>>>> * the person to see that they are not alone in experiencing
certain feelings or thoughts, and this can enhance their sense of self-esteem
>>>>>>> * to reduce secondary emotional reactions, such as feeling
anxious about revealing that they fear, for example, hypoglycaemia, or that
they feel guilty about not coping well with diabetes.
>>>>>>> **Afford the person time to share their experience** (without
interruption, question, or judgement). This makes it more likely that you will
identify the issues of concern. You have earned their initial trust but you
>>>>>>> **Be prepared for the response**. How will you interpret the person’s
response and what actions will you take next? There is a myriad of questions
you could ask, and there are many ways in which the person can respond. Box
1.3 below offers some examples of responses that you may want to consider.
Attempts by you to redirect the questioning to elicit an honest response need
>>>>>>> Refer above to ‘normalise the issues’ – did you do enough to put the
person at their ease to share openly and honestly with you? The person may not
be ready to discuss the matter with you now, so offer them the option to talk
about it another time. Or, perhaps they do not feel comfortable discussing it
with you (e.g. for personal or cultural reasons). In this case, offer the
person an opportunity to discuss the matter with another health professional,
who may be more acceptable to them (e.g. someone they feel they can trust more
or a person of the same sex or cultural background).
>>>>>>> **Be prepared for what to do next**. What can or will you do if you
discover, from open-ended questions or from a questionnaire, that the person
is not OK? What resources are available to you and to the person with

example, ‘Thank you for sharing that with me today [I can see it has been
difficult for you]. I hope it has helped you. Would it be a good idea to talk
about this some more at your next visit?’.
>>>>>>> A general closing might be to invite the person to consider what they
would like to talk about next time, and agree to put it as the first item on
the agenda of the next consultation. You could offer a list of possible
topics, including emotional health issues, for them to choose, if they want

feel a need to fill silences. However, it is OK to give the person an
attentive look (not a stare) and allow some time for them to gather their
thoughts. Then, acknowledge their reluctance and gently prompt with ‘take your
time’. Ask if it is OK to ask another question or if they would like to ask

to feel this way’ or ‘I can see how upsetting this is for you’. Do not try to

much of what you are saying because they are experiencing strong emotions.

>>>>>>>> Proactively, you can set the time at the beginning, for example, ‘We
have about 15 minutes today to discuss these issues; what we don’t finish
today, we can continue to discuss’. If time is becoming an issue during the
consultation, acknowledge this, for example, ‘Your feelings seem overwhelming
at the moment, is that right? We have about [10] minutes left. What can we do
in this time together that would help you most at the moment?’. This is a
better strategy than moving onto something that you think will be quicker.
>>>>>>> ## Overcoming barriers to talk about emotional health in diabetes
>>>>>>> **"[I was] uncertain of the correct advice to give – and worried in
case the patient became aware of my own discomfort." - Diabetes specialist
>>>>>>> **"I feel less confident dealing with psychological problems… [I] want
to pass them on as quickly as possible. I don’t have the training to deal with
them. Even if I had the skills, I only have 20 minutes…" - Diabetes specialist
>>>>>>> As these quotes show, health professionals face many challenges and
barriers in providing adequate psychosocial support to people with diabetes.
>>>>>>> The healthcare professional is required to make a shift from the role
of ‘authoritarian’ (i.e. someone with all the expertise who tells the person
with diabetes what to do) to the role of a listener and collaborator. While,
at first, it may take more time to listen and gain insight into the person’s
perspective, it will lead to establishing a trusting relationship with mutual
respect. Some of the key barriers are described below, to enable you to
reflect on which might apply to your consultations and what you can do to
>>>>>>> From a practical perspective, lack of time remains a perennial barrier
to a more person-centred approach – but many healthcare professionals do
manage to overcome this. Listening to the person’s experiences and needs, and
acknowledging their own way of experiencing their diabetes is a vital
component of person-centred care. Ask yourself, is it ritual or rigid practice
that limits your time? Do you think that if it does not concern diabetes
>>>>>>> One way to deal with time constraints is to agree with the person at
the beginning of the consultation on the priority issues and manage their
expectations about the time available. If there is more to be discussed,
encourage the person to come back and arrange follow-up contact. Even if
initial consultations take some time, there are long term benefits to be
gained. Remember that when the person is distressed they may not be able to
assimilate what you are saying about managing their diabetes better, and may
remain focused on managing their emotions. Furthermore, if emotional health is
not addressed, the problem is likely to become worse. Ultimately, by building
rapport, your subsequent consultations will be much more effective. People
with diabetes are then more satisfied and feel more empowered.
>>>>>>> Many healthcare professionals lack confidence in their own skills and
report sticking to their own agenda as a mechanism for not having to adopt a
person-centred approach. Confidence comes from within, and your skills will
improve with practice. Healthcare professionals may be fearful of what might
be disclosed, or of issues that they cannot solve. Remember, you are not there
to solve all of the person’s problems. Often, all the person with diabetes
wants is to be heard, to have their feelings validated, and to know that
>>>>>>> Many healthcare professionals perceive their skills or expertise to be
limited when it comes to talking about emotions but most have well-developed
communication skills. If you feel you need training, working through this
guide is the perfect first step. It is a learning process, so allow time and
practice, to improve your skills. For some psychological problems, a referral
to a mental health professional will be necessary and it is important to
acknowledge when this will be the case. For many other issues, you may find
that emotional distress is related directly to the experience of dealing with
diabetes on a daily basis. People with diabetes who experience psychological
problems often prefer to talk about this with their diabetes health
professionals or their GP rather than with a mental health specialist. For
example, as diabetes distress is so common and intertwined with diabetes
management, it is best addressed by a diabetes health professional (or the GP
>>>>>>> Lack of psychological services (specifically those with expertise in
both mental health and diabetes) is well documented. However, the Improving
Access to Psychological Therapy (IAPT) service (a) is available in every
clinical commissioning group (CCG) in England and is expected to integrate
their services into physical health care pathways for people with long-term
conditions and medically unexplained symptoms. These services are called IAPT-
LTC. **** It is also important to realise that only a small number of people
with diabetes may need a referral. Up to one in three adults with diabetes
have impaired emotional well-being but they may not need specialist services.
Rather, they may need a diabetes health professional with whom they can talk
about how distressing it is to live with diabetes. They may also benefit from
>>>>>>> You and the person with diabetes may come to the consultation with
different agendas. The best way to find out the individual’s agenda is to ask.
For example: ‘Tell me why you’re here today’, ‘How can I help you today?’, or
‘What would you like to get from today’s consultation?’. People with diabetes
may not be aware that they have the right to ask questions in consultations,
especially about psychosocial issues. Giving them a voice and an opportunity
to teach the health professional about what it is like to live with diabetes
will establish trust, improve rapport, and assist in building a collaborative
>>>>>>> Some healthcare professionals may believe it is too expensive to
integrate routine monitoring of emotional health into their consultations, or
that offering psychological support adds a further financial burden (e.g. on
the health system or on the person with diabetes). However, there is no doubt
that people with diabetes who are distressed fare worse than those who are
not. For instance, depression increases the risk of long-term complications,
healthcare costs, and mortality. So, psychological distress needs to be
considered a cause – not merely a consequence – of complications, and reducing
distress can be considered as a clinically meaningful way to reduce other
diabetes-related complications. This provides an economic rationale for
>>>>>>> ### **Health literacy, language barriers, and passiveness**
>>>>>>> One of the key barriers to effective communication is understanding.
Check the person’s understanding – don’t settle for the ‘smile and nod’. Ask
the person to explain their understanding of what you have told them in their
own words. Do you know why they don’t understand? Is there a language barrier
or health literacy issue? Is your explanation too complex? If they don’t
understand, take the time to explain again in a different way.
>>>>>>> ### **Stigma/myths about mental health and diabetes**
>>>>>>> Fear of stigma and negative stereotyping can reduce the effectiveness
of a consultation. In extreme cases the consultation may become a sterile,
ineffective exchange based on what the person thinks you want to hear and/or
what the person is prepared to share with you. Experiences of stigma may
discourage a person from engaging in self-care activities, attending future
consultations, or seeking professional support. Healthcare professionals may
convey stigmatising attitudes unintentionally in their language, actions, and
reactions. Consider how your words and actions might inadvertently reflect
>>>>>>> It is worth finding ways to overcome any of these barriers if you are
experiencing them. The reality is that we work more effectively and
efficiently when we seek to understand the person’s feelings and their reasons
for distress, particularly when these underpin their self-care behaviours.
>>>>>>> Clinical psychologist, Dr Mark Davies, notes ‘Many diabetes
professionals have highly developed communication skills and years of
experience of dealing with people whose lives have been affected by diabetes.
Whilst lack of time can frequently be an issue, it may well be that many…

feeling positive about their handling of emotional health issues once they
have tried engaging in such conversations. Furthermore, they realise that they
had the skills to do so and that they applied them successfully during the

source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury and remedying." - Albus
Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows**
>>>>>>> A key element of communication is the use of language. Words can be
incredibly powerful, so it is important to choose them carefully.
>>>>>>> NHS England has published a position statement about language, which
>>>>>>> * **Words have impact** : Words can impact positively or
negatively on the person with diabetes. The language you use can affect the
person’s willingness to confide in you; it can also impact their motivation,
>>>>>>> * **Words can label the person or perpetuate negative
stereotypes** : For example, the label ‘diabetic’ defines the person by their
medical condition, and ‘patient’ implies dependency on the health system. In
contrast, referring to the ‘person with diabetes’ acknowledges other facets of
their identify/life/personality which are equally salient for them, and that
they are functioning successfully in their own home/work environment.
>>>>>>> * **Words can be judgemental or demotivating:** Many people
with diabetes report feeling criticised for not managing their diabetes well,
yet they often feel they are doing the best they can. For example, criticism
may be implied by phrases like ‘poorly controlled’ or ‘failing to manage’, and
can leave people with diabetes feeling demoralised and that their efforts are
under-valued. The words you choose to use may stay with that person long after
you have forgotten the consultation. It is important to acknowledge how
>>>>>>> * **Words can lead to missed opportunities, or create them**
: Diabetes is a life-long condition and people will, naturally, have times
when diabetes is not their main priority, or when they are struggling with
self-management. Labelling the person as ‘non-compliant’, ‘poorly controlled’,
or ‘uncooperative’ can lead to missed opportunities to engage the person in a
conversation about why things are not going well and how you can support them.
>>>>>>> * **Words can impact upon the relationship between the
health professional and person with diabetes** : It is best to use words that
neutralise any judgement about the outcome. Instead of referring to ‘good
control’ or ‘poor control’, refer to blood glucose levels being ‘in target’ or
‘above target’. Rather than directing the person with phrases like ‘you must…’
or ‘you should…’, choose words like ‘you have some choices here…’ and ‘let’s
discuss your options…’, which respect the individual’s autonomy and indicate a

mental health of people with diabetes. In particular, questionnaires about
diabetes distress can help to focus the agenda of the consultation on any
challenges the person may be experiencing related to living with and managing
>>>>>>> Questionnaires can be used effectively in specialist care and primary
care settings. People with diabetes and health professionals alike value the
assessment and discussion of outcomes, and generally express greater
satisfaction with consultations in which this has taken place. Follow-up
studies have shown that using questionnaires and discussing the outcomes,
leads to reductions in diabetes distress and improvements in HbA1c.
>>>>>>> There are several well-validated, reliable, and easy-to-use
questionnaires for assessing the emotional health of people living with
diabetes. They are featured in relevant chapters of this guide. And master
copies of the questionnaires are included too, to enable you to reproduce them
for clinical use, or you may print copies from the Full PDF version of this
>>>>>>> Before using questionnaires in your consultations, here are some
>>>>>>> * **Have a good reason:** Be clear about why you are asking
someone to complete a questionnaire. For example, it is appropriate to use a
diabetes distress questionnaire on a routine basis because the issue is
relevant to most people and because the person’s responses can help you tailor
their diabetes management plan to their needs. You can also monitor their
distress over time. However, asking people to complete a large quantity of
unnecessary questionnaires just so you have their ‘score’ on record is a waste
>>>>>>> * **Explain your reasons for asking the person to complete a
questionnaire:** Explain why the questions are relevant to their individual
situation. People will be more inclined to respond (and tell you how they
really feel) if they realise you are trying to understand their experience of
living with diabetes so you can be of greater help to them. Otherwise, they
may perceive it as a waste of time and resources. Importantly, reassure them
it is not a ‘test’ and there are no right or wrong answers. Also, reassure
them that the information will be treated as confidential and tell them what
you intend to do with the completed questionnaire (e.g. will you keep the
>>>>>>> * **Choose your method and timing wisely:** Select a method
for administering the questionnaire that will be most suitable and convenient
for the person with diabetes and yourself. Some people may prefer completing a
questionnaire using their smartphone, a tablet computer, or via a website.
Electronic versions may also be more convenient if they automatically
calculate total scores and link with the person’s electronic health records.
However, some people may not feel comfortable with the technology and will
prefer traditional pen and paper. Similarly, consider your timing – often
people will be more willing to complete a questionnaire if they are asked to
do so in the waiting room before an appointment, rather than at home or during
>>>>>>> * **Questionnaires can save time and help you get to the
heart of an issue:** Inviting the person to complete the questionnaire in the
waiting room before they come in to see you can prepare them for the
conversation to follow. You can then quickly skim their questionnaire
responses to enable you to start a conversation about the issues of most
capabilities:** Health literacy, language barriers, disability, and other
factors may affect a person’s ability to understand and/or complete a
questionnaire on their own. Differing cultural perceptions of health and
mental health may impair the validity and interpretation of the questionnaire.
If you have concerns about the suitability of a questionnaire for the person,
consider other options. For example, can you read the questions and response
options out loud to them? Is there a suitable questionnaire in their first
language or validated for their cultural group? Could you ask open-ended
>>>>>>> * **Questionnaires may not always be the best way of
gathering information:** Asking open-ended questions is a valid and practical
alternative. Questions such as ‘What is it about living with diabetes that you
find most difficult?’ and ‘How does that make you feel?’ can help you gain
some insight on these issues without using a questionnaire, and makes the

or your interest in having a conversation? Will the person feel comfortable
raising sensitive issues with you in the space?
>>>>>>> * **Computer:** It is difficult to type and talk at the same
time; it’s even harder to type and listen at the same time. Give the person in
front of you your full attention. Show that you are listening and, above all,
>>>>>>> * **Lack of privacy or interruptions:** If you do not have a
private room or are continually distracted by interruptions or noise, this can
make the person with diabetes feel unimportant or that this is not necessarily
a safe space to open up to you. Can interruptions be prevented? Can you put a
sign on the door, close the blinds, and put your phone on silent?
>>>>>>> **"We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are." -
>>>>>>> We refer to people with diabetes from the general adult population
but, of course, the UK is a country of diversity. It is beyond the scope of
these guidelines to consider the specific needs of every social and cultural
group, or the specific approaches they may require. However, we offer below
some tips for those working with diverse groups, and signposts to appropriate
resources. Guidelines and checklists are less important than ‘a reflective
approach that avoids stereotypes and assumptions in providing care that is

communication strategies to meet the needs of all members of the community.
The majority of this chapter advocates for an open, empathic communication
style; however, keep in mind that this approach may not be suitable for every
person – consider diversity and be reflective in your approach to
>>>>>>> Being aware of your own personal attitudes, assumptions, and
stereotypes will help you to put these to one side and minimise their
influence on the discussion. You can then focus on understanding the values
and wishes of the individual as they discuss their health with you.
>>>>>>> In certain situations, the individual may feel more comfortable if a
family member, friend, advocate, community/spiritual leader, or other trusted
person can attend the consultation. Make sure people know they are welcome to
>>>>>>> Health literacy is more than basic literacy and numeracy skills; it
includes a person’s ability to understand and apply health-related information
and their ability to navigate the health system. Low health literacy is very
common – between 43% and 61% of English working age adults routinely do not
understand health information so be aware of the signs (see Box 1.4). Do not
assume that people will tell you openly; many will not say anything for fear
>>>>>>> People with lower health literacy can be very reliant on the verbal
information passed on to them by health professionals. Think about what is
required of a person with diabetes during a standard consultation – they need
to provide information to their health professional, understand and make
decisions based on the information that their health professional gives them,
>>>>>>> When they go home, they need to remember everything that took place
and was said during the consultation and apply it. Imagine how challenging
that might be for a person who has not clearly understood the message that
their health professional has tried to convey to them, and how it might impact
on their self-care and health outcomes. Now, imagine having to do this not
only for diabetes but for eye screening, foot care and other aspects of
>>>>>>> Some of the tips listed in the table above will be particularly
helpful for people with lower levels of health literacy. These tips include
using plain English and anecdotes/ storytelling/visual aids, encouraging
questions, repeating key information, and checking understanding (yours and

of origin, culture, religion, first language, and other characteristics. Given
this, it is impossible to provide specific advice to suit everyone, but here
>>>>>>> Culture plays a large role in shaping values, beliefs, and practices.
People from diverse backgrounds may have different beliefs, values, and
practices from your own. It is ethical practice to reflect on your own
cultural bias and to be aware of how this may influence your practice, and to
be mindful of this in your communications and care. For example, people may

pictorial, or verbal communication, or a passive or assertive manner)

health professional, or a preference for traditional cultural remedies over

>>>>>>> #### **Recognise and adapt to language challenges**
>>>>>>> While English is the primary language of over 90% of UK
residents,138,000 people living in the UK cannot speak English at all and over
60% of these are women. It is also important to be aware that being proficient
in English does not mean someone is proficient in medical terminology.
Language barriers can impede communication and impact on the quality and
uptake of care, and physical and mental health outcomes. Be willing to adapt
the ways that you communicate and work to meet the needs of the person. It is
also important to use an accredited interpreter rather than rely on family or
friends. See ‘Resources’ section for information about translating and

approach is not appropriate and does not work.

advisable to consult guidelines for working with interpreters
>>>>>>> Finally, bear in mind that disabilities (e.g. physical, intellectual,
cognitive) may impact on a person’s emotional state, and their ability to
communicate or understand. Making appropriate arrangements to help people with
these challenges is also part of recognising diversity.
