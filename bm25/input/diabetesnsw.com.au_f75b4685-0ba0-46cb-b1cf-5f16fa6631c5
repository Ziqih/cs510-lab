# 3D bioprinter to revolutionise type 1 treatments
In an Australian first, researchers at the University of Wollongong have
designed and built a customised 3D bioprinter that promises to revolutionise
The printer will be capable of delivering insulin-producing islet cells from a
protective bioink into a printed scaffold suitable for transplant.
The Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation (PICT) 3D Printer was officially
handed over to South Australian Minister for Health Peter Malinauskas for use
at the Royal Adelaide Hospital on the 6 December 2017 by ARC Centre of
Excellence for Electromaterials Science (ACES) Executive Director and ANFF
TheRoyal Adelaide Hospital is the first hospital in Australia to receive this
cutting edge biomedical printing device, developed by researchers from ACES
and ANFF Materials, headquartered at the University of Wollongong.
Professor Wallace said the development and hand over of the PICT Printer
marked a new era in manufacturing as ACES researchers continue to expand their
clinical connections and explore new opportunities for customised 3D
“ACES at the University of Wollongong has built a collaborative clinical
research network that enables us to tackle big clinical challenges and deliver
practical solutions using 3D bioprinting,” Professor Wallace said.
“In collaboration with Professor Toby Coates’ team at Royal Adelaide Hospital,
we plan to improve the effectiveness of islet cell transplants by
encapsulating donated islet cells in a 3D printed structure, to protect them
Currently only the most severe cases of type 1 diabetes can be treated with
islet cell transplantation from human donors. These donor islet cells restore
the diabetes sufferer’s ability to produce insulin and regulate their blood
The printed transplant material has the potential to reduce the likelihood of
rejection as a patient’s own cells could be used. Also, because multiple cell
types can be printed in the same run, endothelial cells – essential for
installing blood flow to the grafted islet cells – can be implanted, improving
The Director of Kidney and Islet Transplantation at Royal Adelaide Hospital,
Professor Toby Coates said being at the forefront of research gave hope to
“The PICT Printer will allow us to make customised organs, mixing donor with
recipient cells in a unique 3 dimensional way to provide completely new
