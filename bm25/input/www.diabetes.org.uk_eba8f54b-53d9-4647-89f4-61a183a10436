When it comes to your diet, you probably already know you need to eat less
saturated fat, salt and sugar and at least five portions of fruit and
vegetables a day. But did you know that wholegrains should also feature? As a
nation, we are not eating enough of them.
Wholegrains are the seeds of cereal plants such as wheat, maize, corn, rye,
barley, oats, rice and quinoa. In their natural unprocessed state, grains
The endosperm is the central part of the grain and is a concentrated source of
starch. The outer most layer, the bran, is a rich source of insoluble dietary
fibre, B vitamins and phytochemicals. The germ is a concentrated source of
protein, ‘healthy’ fats, B vitamins and vitamin E.
When wholegrains are refined, for instance to make white flour, most of the
bran and germ are removed and with it most of the nutrients, dietary fibre and
other protective components, which are concentrated in the bran and germ
Wholegrain foods, retain all three parts of the grain. They may be eaten whole
(eg brown rice and oats), cracked (eg bulgur wheat), or milled into flour and
made into foods like bread and pasta. To qualify as a wholegrain, a food must
contain 51 per cent or more wholegrain ingredients by weight per serving.
Wholegrains are a smart choice, not just for people with diabetes, but for the
whole family. If you do have diabetes, wholegrain foods are usually better for
managing blood glucose levels because they tend to have a lower glycaemic
index (GI). This means they do not affect blood glucose levels as quickly as
refined carbohydrate foods. However, since wholegrains are also carbohydrate
foods, and all carbohydrates affect blood glucose levels, be mindful of your
Some studies have shown that healthy diets, rich in wholegrain foods, can
reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, certain types of cancer and Type 2
diabetes. The ways in which wholegrains help prevent these conditions are not
fully understood. They can play a part in maintaining a healthy body weight
over time as part of a healthy, balanced diet and help keep your gut healthy
due to the compounds they contain called phytochemicals. Studies also suggest
that wholegrain foods may be more filling than their refined counterparts,
which may help reduce the urge for snacking between meals and help people

## What’s the difference between wholemeal, wholewheat, wholegrain and granary
Wholemeal, wholewheat and wholegrain bread are basically different terms for
the same thing and all are wholegrain. However, granary bread is slightly
different and refers to bread that contains malted wheat flakes that are added
to give it a characteristic texture. This may or may not be made from
wholemeal flour, so you will need to check the label. Wheat-germ bread is made
from white flour to which a portion of wheat germ has been added back, it is
There are plenty of simple and tasty ways to introduce wholegrains into your
* Swap white bread for wholemeal bread – look for the words ‘wholegrain’ or ‘wholemeal’ on the label.
* Choose brown rice instead of white – look out for brown basmati and quick-cook brown rice.
* Use wholemeal flour for baking – if you’re not used to baking with wholemeal flour start by substituting half the white flour with wholemeal. As you get used to cooking with wholemeal flour you can gradually increase the proportion.
* Choose oatcakes or Ryvita or wholemeal crackers instead of cream crackers.
* Popcorn is a wholegrain so as a treat swap crisps or other savoury for unsalted sugar-free popcorn.
* Corn on the cob is wholegrain, or you can add sweetcorn to recipes like spaghetti bolognese or chilli con carne.
