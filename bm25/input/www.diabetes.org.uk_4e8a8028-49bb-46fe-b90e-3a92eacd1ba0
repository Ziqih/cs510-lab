A pudding of stewed rhubarb, sweetened with artificial sweetener and folded
Please view Whisk.com privacy policy for more information
artificial sweetener (equivalent to 6 tsp sugar, eg 6 stevia tablets, crushed)
1. Add the rhubarb to a pan with 3 tbsp water and the sugar. Bring to the boil, turn down the heat, add a lid and simmer for 6 minutes, stirring regularly, adding another tablespoon of water if it starts to stick. The rhubarb should be soft, but still hold its shape.
2. Transfer the rhubarb to a bowl and add the artificial sweetener. Mix well and taste adding a little more artificial sweetener if needed, then leave to cool. Remember the yogurt and cream contain natural sugars so don't over sweeten.
3. In a bowl, mix the yogurt and crème fraiche together and fold in the rhubarb. Place in glasses and chill before serving.
* Can be made in advance and kept in the fridge for a few hours. Or if you want to make it a day before serving, just chill the rhubarb separately and mix with the yogurt and crème fraiche when needed.
* This recipe works well with other tart fruits, such as gooseberries or redcurrants.
* You can use most fruit, although you won't need to sweeten it quite as much if the fruit is sweet. Try apricots, peaches, nectarines, raspberries or cherries.
* For a vegan version, use a soya or coconut-based non-dairy alternative.
