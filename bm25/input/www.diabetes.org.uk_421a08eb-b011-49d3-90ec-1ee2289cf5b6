>>>>>>> An open-label, multi-centre, randomised, parallel design study to
assess the efficacy of flash glucose monitoring in adults with type 1 diabetes
>>>>>>> Flash glucose monitoring gives people with diabetes a simple and
painless way to monitor their blood glucose levels. But not everyone who would
benefit has access to this life-changing technology. Dr Lalantha Leelarathna
will compare the impact and costs of Flash 2 to finger pricks tests in people
with Type 1 diabetes. This will provide important evidence that could help
make Flash more widely available on the NHS, to transform the lives of people
>>>>>>> Monitoring blood sugar levels is a vital part of day-to-day life for
people with diabetes. This usually means finger prick tests, which can be
painful and inconvenient, and many people struggle to do the recommended 4-10
>>>>>>> But new flash glucose monitoring could change this. Flash involves a
small sensor that sits just underneath your skin and continuously measures
glucose in the fluid that surrounds your body’s cells. To get a reading, you
can painlessly swipe a reader over the sensor. Flash also lets you see the
direction your blood sugar is heading and the next generation of this tech -
Flash 2 - will include alarms which alert you when you're going too low or too
>>>>>>> In 2019, Flash became available on prescription across the UK to those
who meet the criteria. But it’s estimated only 20% of people with Type 1
diabetes will be eligible, meaning many who could benefit will be denied
access. In part, this is because we don’t yet have strong research evidence
showing the value of Flash or its cost-effectiveness. And as Flash 2 hasn't
launched yet, there isn't any research looking into its impact.
>>>>>>> Dr Leelarathna will find out if Flash 2 improves blood sugar levels,
compared to finger prick testing, in people with Type 1 diabetes who have an
above target HbA1c. Dr Leelarathna thinks this group is likely to see the
biggest gains in blood sugar control from using the device.
>>>>>>> Around 150 participants will be asked to monitor their blood sugar
levels with either Flash 2 or finger pricks for 12 weeks. Dr Leelarathna will
look for any differences in blood sugar control between the two groups.
>>>>>>> The research team will also explore the impact of Flash 2 on people’s
satisfaction with their treatment and quality of life. Finally, they’ll study
the cost-effectiveness of Flash 2, to give the NHS important information to
>>>>>>> ### Potential benefit to people with diabetes
>>>>>>> At the moment only those who meet strict NHS criteria, or who can
afford to self-fund Flash, have access to this life-changing technology. This
research will help determine if the next generation of this tech - Flash 2 -
is both beneficial and cost-effective. We need this vital evidence to support
widening the NHS eligibility criteria and help making living with Type 1
