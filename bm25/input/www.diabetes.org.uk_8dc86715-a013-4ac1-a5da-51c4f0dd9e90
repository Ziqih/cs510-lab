# Lack of care planning failing people with diabetes
Almost two thirds of people with diabetes do not have a personal care plan in
place despite them being vital for enabling people to manage the condition.
Diabetes UK's annual online survey about the healthcare people with diabetes
receive, which was completed by 1,609 people with the condition, has found
that 64.9 per cent of people said they had no care plan in place.
## Every person with diabetes should receive personalised care planning
This is despite strong evidence that giving people with long-term conditions
greater control over how their condition is managed improves their health
outcomes, which is why the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
recommends that every person with diabetes should receive personalised care
This enables people to be much more involved in agreeing with their health
care team how best to manage their own diabetes and this, in turn, can help
reduce the risk of serious complications such as kidney failure, amputations,
Treating complications accounts for 80 per cent of the £10 billion per year
the NHS spends on diabetes, but many of them could be prevented through better
ongoing management of the condition. This is why Diabetes UK is calling on NHS
organisations to ensure everyone with diabetes has a personalised care plan.
It is also urging people with the condition to make sure they are aware of the
importance of care planning, and to help address the lack of awareness the
charity has launched an animation showing how people can get more involved in
Barbara Young, Chief Executive of Diabetes UK, said: “We know that
personalised care planning helps put people with diabetes in the driving seat
and, crucially, gives them a better chance of a long and healthy life. After
all, healthcare professionals might only spend a few hours a year with someone
with diabetes, while it is the person who has the condition who has to manage
### "To be effective the personal care plan must not be a tick box exercise"
“Personalised care planning is not about a person having a sheet on the file
at their GP surgery that says ‘personal care plan’. To be effective it must
not be a tick box exercise. It is about giving the person with diabetes the
opportunity to work together with their healthcare team to be more informed,
more vocal and play a bigger role in their care. For example, they should come
prepared with the results of their tests and be ready to have a meaningful
conversation about what needs to be done next. This might result in attending
structured education, trying new medication or being referred to a slimming
club. It’s about giving people the right information and ability to access
“By helping prevent complications, care planning is good news for people with
diabetes and good news for the NHS’s finances, which is why we want more
people to get it. We need to get the message across to the NHS that if people
with diabetes do not have personalised care planning at the moment, then this
needs to be rectified urgently and in some cases this will need to be built
“But equally, it is really important that people with diabetes understand what
healthcare they are entitled to so that they can hold the NHS to account if
they are not getting it. Ournew animationshows that people with diabetes need
to be central to decisions about their care and we hope it gets across this
