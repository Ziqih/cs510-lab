# UK lagging behind Europe for use of insulin pumps
The fact that the NHS is not providing insulin pumps to enough people with
Type 1 diabetes – compared to much higher access rates in other European
nations – may be exposing them to greater risk of serious health
Diabetes UK and JDRF expressed concerns as the UK’s first ever audit of
insulin pump use, published today, revealed that just seven per cent of the
estimated 247,500 UK people with Type 1 diabetes use a pump.
## Pump usage lagging behind Europe and USA
Usage in the UK is thought to have gone up over the last five years. But the
report highlights that the seven per cent figure is still much lower than in
countries such as Germany and Norway, where over 15 per cent of those with
Type 1 diabetes use a pump. In the US, use of insulin pumps is even more
widespread, with some 40 per cent of people with Type 1 having one.
The picture in the UK is slightly better for children, with 19 per cent of
under-18s with Type 1 using a pump, but this is still much lower than
The report was published today by Ian Gallen, Fellow of the National Institute
for Clinical Excellence (NICE), and supported by the Association of British
Clinical Diabetologists as well as the charities Diabetes UK and JDRF.
Diabetes UK and JDRF are both concerned that some people with Type 1 diabetes
who would gain maximum benefit are continuing to be denied access to a pump.
The report suggests the UK’s poor performance is linked to the low number of
healthcare professionals qualified to train people with Type 1 diabetes to use
a pump, with the lack of diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs) a particular
We are calling on the NHS to ensure that every child with Type 1 diabetes is
able to access specialist paediatric teams, and that adult diabetes teams are
commissioned to ensure access to a DSN who is experienced in pump management.
This would deliver a big increase in pump usage in the UK.
Barbara Young, Chief Executive for Diabetes UK, said, "While not everyone with
Type 1 diabetes wants a pump, it is important that those who would benefit and
meet NICE guidance are able to access one, as pumps help some people to
maintain a better level of blood glucose control than is possible through
"This means that, long term, having a pump can reduce risk of complications
such as amputation and blindness, can significantly improve quality of life
and play a real role in helping people to manage their own condition. This, in
turn, can reduce the number of people with Type 1 diabetes who die before
"This new report suggests that getting more healthcare professionals qualified
to train people with Type 1 diabetes to use a pump is big part of the
solution. We now need the NHS to make this happen, as part of its commitment
to ensuring everyone with diabetes has the best possible chance of a long and
Karen Addington, Chief Executive of JDRF, said, "Access to pumps for those
living with Type 1 has increased over the last five years, but at a glacial
pace – from two per cent to seven per cent.
"JDRF has long pushed the message that increased investment in research to
cure, treat and prevent Type 1 diabetes and its complications is vital. But
furthermore, this report highlights the crucial importance of actual access to
the treatments that come from this research. After all, insulin pumps were
first endorsed for UK patients by the National Institute for Clinical
## "A good way from where we should be"
Publisher of the report, Ian Gallen said, "Whilst the national picture is
improving, we are still a good way from where we should be with pump
treatment. There are people who are having problems managing their diabetes
who do not have the option of an insulin pump offered to them in a timely way,
"The commissioners of diabetes services must study our audit so they can
ensure they commission appropriate specialist diabetes services, meaning that
people can quickly move to pump treatment when needed."
This was the first comprehensive audit of insulin pump access in the UK,
involving the participation of 97 per cent of hospital trusts that provide
