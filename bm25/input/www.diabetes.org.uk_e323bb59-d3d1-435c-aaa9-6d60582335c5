New analysis by Diabetes UK has revealed that the number of diabetes-related
amputations in England has now reached an all-time high of 20 a day.The
figures, calculated using new Public Health England data (1), show that the
annual number of diabetes-related amputations in England is now 7,370 a year,
compared to the previous figure of 7,042. Yet, with good diabetes healthcare
and support, experts estimate that four out of five amputations could be
prevented as 80 per cent begin as foot ulcers, which are largely avoidable and
far more treatable if found early.The figures show that despite welcome action
in some areas of the country on preventing diabetes -related amputations, the
overall rate has stayed the same. And because of the sharp increase in the
number of people with diabetes in the past 20 years, the number of diabetes-
related amputations is continuing to rise. Diabetic foot disease remains the
most common cause of hospital admission associated with the condition.While
there is some good news that the major amputation rate (classed as amputations
above the ankle) has decreased slightly since Diabetes UK launched the Putting
Feet First campaign in 2012 (2), the charity is alarmed that the variation
rates between the best and the worst performing areas continue to widen. Those
areas more successful in tackling diabetes-related amputation continue to
lower their rates, whereas the rate for the worst performing has not dropped
in the last year.Diabetes UK is calling on the Government and the NHS to do
more to tackle the devastating and life-changing problem of diabetes-related
amputation by improving diabetes footcare. The charity wants to see targeted
action to improve the worst performing areas where rates are worsening or
failing to improve.It is vital that everyone with diabetes has access to
multidisciplinary footcare teams to make sure problems are identified and
treated early and urgently. It is particularly important that if anyone with
diabetes has a foot infection or new ulcer they get urgent attention from a
team of specialists as evidence shows the longer the delay before seeing a
specialist team, the more likely it is that foot ulcers will be severe and
slow to heal, leading to a greater risk of amputation.Chris Askew, Chief
Executive of Diabetes UK, said: “The fact that the total number of amputations
is continuing to rise is a huge concern. We know the devastating impact they
have on people’s lives as well as the huge cost to the NHS, yet we are not
seeing action happening quickly enough across all areas of the country to
address this.“We have seen some areas making real efforts to improve the poor
state of diabetes footcare, but these figures are a stark reminder that there
is still so much more to be done, especially with regard to significant
variation from GP practices and between different health areas. It’s a
travesty that good quality foot care is a postcode lottery. People need to be
getting the right care in the right place at the right time now.”Chris Brown,
64, from Bristol, has lost both legs below the knee due to his diabetes, the
first in May 2009 and the second in December 2015. He now says even the most
basic tasks can leave him struggling.“As I have no feeling at all in my lower
legs it can be tough to even work out when I’m upright and properly balanced.
I fall regularly and things that I used to do without thinking will take
forever to accomplish.“I used to be a voracious reader but now I struggle to
concentrate in the way I used to. I moved to a bungalow after my second
amputation and while it does make my life significantly easier in many ways it
also means I am seven miles away from town and it has made it harder for me to
see friends and family. I don’t want anyone to underestimate how life-changing
amputations are and how it will impact on your life in ways you can’t even
