# Health bodies urge ban on e-cigarettes in smoke-free areas
The Heart Foundation, The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand and
over 20 of the state’s most prominent health organisations are today calling
for the NSW Minister for Health to ban the use of e-cigarettes in smoke-free
“The laws in NSW currently allow people to use e-cigarettes anywhere – this
means people can use them on buses and trains, at shopping centres, cafes,

NSW is one of the last states in Australia to prohibit the use of e-cigarettes
in smoke-free public spaces. Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian
Capital Territory have all already enacted legislation to protect their
communities from exposure to e-cigarettes, and last week South Australia

* 16 per cent of young smokers in NSW are using e-cigarettes and a quarter of this group believe they are not as bad as cigarettes.
* In 2014/15, one in seven Australians aged 15 years and over smoked daily and research on the risks of e-cigarette vapours is still being undertaken.
