In Australia today , at least 50% of women and over 60% of men are overweight.
Choosing healthy foods and being active will help manage your blood glucose
levels and your weight. Healthy eating recommendations for people with
diabetes are similar to those for everyone, so there’s no need to prepare
separate meals or buy special foods. Healthy eating can be enjoyed by your
If you’re overweight, the best way to lose weight (and keep it off) is through

Healthy eating for diabetes includes selecting high fibre, lower Glycaemic
Index (GI) carbohydrate foods and reducing fat, especially saturated fat.
You’ll need to balance your food intake with exercise to maintain a healthy
The Dietary Guidelines for all Australians, produced by the National Health
and Medical Research Council, are an excellent guide to help you make healthy
food choices. In addition to following the Dietary Guidelines, there are a few
***Eat regular meals and snacks** evenly throughout the day. This provides your body with a regular supply of energy and can help to control blood glucose levels (BGLs). If you need to lose some weight, eat nutritious lower energy snacks, like fruit or diet yoghurt, or limit how often you snack.
***Include carbohydrate foods** in each meal and snack. **Carbohydrate foods** are the best source of energy for your body and have a direct effect on your BGLs. They include:
* Starchy vegetables (potato, sweet potato and corn)
* Some dairy products (milk, yoghurt and dairy desserts)
* The type, as well as the amount, of carbohydrate you eat at a meal is important. The amount of carbohydrate you need depends on many factors, including your body weight and how active you are. Your healthcare team can help you create a personalised eating plan.
* The Glycaemic Index, or GI, is a ranking of carbohydrates in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels. Foods with a low GI raise BGLs more slowly and steadily than foods with a high GI. If you have diabetes you can benefit from eating low GI foods throughout the day, ideally one at each meal. **Low GI** **foods** to enjoy include:
***Choose foods lower in total fat** and in particular low in saturated fats. Eating too much fat in general, and saturated fat in particular, can lead to weight gain, which may lead to increased blood glucose and cholesterol levels. **Saturated fat** is found mainly in:
* Animal foods, like meat, cheese, butter and full-cream dairy products
* Many pre-packaged foods like biscuits and chips
* To **reduce your saturated fat** intake, try to choose:
* Include small amounts of the healthier fats. Some fat in the diet is important for good health. Using a variety of healthier fats will achieve a good balance. **Healthier fats** include:
* Poly- and mono-unsaturated margarines and oils, such as canola or olive
* All dietary fat in excess can contribute to weight gain, so consume an amount that is suitable for you.
***Choose high fibre foods**. Fibre has many benefits for the body including:
* A high fibre meal also leaves you feeling fuller, which can assist with weight loss. To improve your fibre intake, choose wholegrain or high fibre breads and cereals and plenty of vegetables, legumes and fruit.
***A word on sugar**. A myth that continues to surround diabetes is that the diet must be low-sugar or sugar-free. We now know that this is not the case. Studies of the Glycaemic Index have shown that some types of sugar, such as those found in fruit or milk, convert to glucose more slowly in the body. While it’s still important to limit foods that are concentrated sources of sugar, or high in added refined sugar, like soft drinks, lollies and syrups, small amounts of sugar can be included as part of a lower fat, high fibre meal for people with diabetes.
***Shopping tours**. If you’re finding the information on selecting healthy food options overwhelming, you may want to attend one of our healthy shopping tours. The tours (in the Sydney metropolitan and some regional areas) teach you how to read food labels and help make selecting healthy foods easier. For more information call our Helpline on 1300 342 238.
