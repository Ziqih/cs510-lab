# We welcome the new GIRFT report calling for vital improvements in diabetes
![We welcome the new GIRFT report calling for vital improvements in key areas
Released today, the long awaited Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) diabetes
national report outlines a series of recommendations to improve care and
Professors Gerry Rayman and Partha Kar, who led the report, visited over 100
hospitals providing diabetes services across England. They spoke to healthcare
professionals, reviewed the services currently available and collected data to
analyse. This helped them identify several key areas where change is needed to
ensure people with diabetes get the support and care they need. These areas
Despite huge advances and investment in footcare, one in six hospitals in
England still does not have a multidisciplinary footcare team. These are teams
that include consultants who specialise in diabetes, podiatrists, diabetes
nurse specialists and other healthcare professionals with experience treating
and managing foot problems caused by diabetes. The report found that hospitals
with these teams provide better care for people with diabetes.
Professors Rayman and Kar therefore recommend that all NHS trusts should have
a dedicated multidisciplinary footcare team, as stated in the NHS Long Term
We support this recommendation, as we know that most foot problems can be
prevented with good, regular footcare. That’s why it’s important that people
with diabetes can access high quality footcare services wherever they live, so
early opportunities to identify and treat foot problems are not lost.
The report found that when people with diabetes go to hospital, because of
their diabetes or otherwise, they often experience avoidable harm from poor
To improve such care, the Professors recommend that all NHS trusts should have
multidisciplinary diabetes inpatient teams. These teams should include nurses,
pharmacists, dietitians, psychologists and podiatrists who are experienced in
diabetes care and can offer support where needed.
They also suggest trusts should offer electronic prescribing, which allows
prescriptions to be signed, sent and processed electronically. This can help
healthcare professionals ensure medicines are used safely and correctly in

safe for people with diabetes. This is particularly important during the
pandemic, as we know people with diabetes are at risk of poor outcomes if they
catch coronavirus. If hospital care is needed, we must ensure they get the
When looking at type 1 diabetes care specifically, Professors Rayman and Kar
found huge differences in levels of access to diabetes technology across
They recommend that access to technology should be made available to all
people with type 1 diabetes who need it, and that this should be as close as
Diabetes technology has the potential to improve lives by helping people
manage their condition better. We know the benefits and impact it can have,
and that’s why we agree that everyone with type 1 should be able to access the

The findings of the GIRFT report confirm what we already know about the
improvements that must be made to diabetes care across England.
But with the number of people living with the condition growing every year,
it’s vital that the recommendations in this report are put into practice, so
more people can get the quality of care they need to manage their diabetes
