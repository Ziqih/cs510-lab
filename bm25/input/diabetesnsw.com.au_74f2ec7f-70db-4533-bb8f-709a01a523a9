# Genome may explain origins of type 1 diabetes
A study published in the journal Nature Communications has pinpointed a number
of areas of the human genome that may help explain the neonatal origins of
chronic immune and inflammatory conditions of later life, including type 1
The research, led by scientists at the Cambridge Baker Systems Genomics
Initiative, identified several genes that appear to drive risk at birth, and
which could be targeted for therapeutic intervention to stop these conditions
Dr Michael Inouye, Munz Chair of Cardiovascular Prediction and Prevention at
the Baker Institute and Principal Researcher at Cambridge University, said
chronic immune and inflammatory conditions of adulthood often originated in
early childhood, with an individual's genetic make-up causing changes to the
For this study, the team collected cord blood samples from more than 100
Australian newborns as part of the Childhood Asthma Study, and investigated
the role of genetic variation in DNA in changing how genes are expressed in
the two main arms of the immune system.
The neonatal immune cells were exposed to certain stimuli, to see how the
cells responded and to identify genetic variants that changed these responses.
"We looked for overlap between these genetic signals and those that are known
to be associated with diseases where we know the immune system plays a role,"
"We then used statistical analysis to search for possible links between the
cell response in newborns and immune diseases in adulthood."
Chronic immune conditions - including type 1 diabetes, coeliac disease and
multiple sclerosis - are caused by an overactive immune system and affect
Allergies are immune-mediated too and affect one in five Australians, with hay
fever, asthma, eczema, anaphylaxis and food allergies the most common.
Inflammation and autoimmunity are also known to be driving factors in
cardiovascular diseases, for example when an overactive immune system
Dr Qinqin Huang, lead author of the study and now a researcher at the Wellcome
Sanger Institute in Cambridge, said the findings were unique in their scale,
with thousands of genetic variants driving gene expression across different
immune and inflammatory conditions, some of which had wide-ranging effects.
"Our study showed the potential roles of gene expression in disease
development, which has helped us to better understand the link between DNA
To date, similar studies have only been conducted in adult immune cells. Given
the huge difference between neonatal and adult immunity, it is not surprising
to see many signals that were unique to newborns."

The study is part of the Cambridge Baker Systems Genomics Initiative's wider
work in developing polygenic risk scores to predict an individual's likelihood
of developing particular chronic diseases. To date, the team have already
developed potential methods to test for future risk of stroke and coronary
"Disease is partly due to changes, both large and small, in our genome - the
DNA that we're born with and which is a major driving force in all our cells.
That means, genomics can be used to estimate disease risk from a very early
"Common conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, tend
to be polygenic - influenced by a large number of genetic variants scattered
throughout the genome, which combine with environmental and lifestyle
"By using new genomic technology and supercomputing capabilities, we can sift
through this DNA data and piece together the puzzles that underlie each
"With so many diseases sharing a root in the immune system and inflammation we
can leverage this information to better understand where each disease has a
molecular weak spot and to what extent these are shared among different
"We've shown this can be dissected using genetics and polygenic risk,
hopefully leading to targeted preventative interventions for those who need
them most, with the aim of keeping people living healthier for longer."
