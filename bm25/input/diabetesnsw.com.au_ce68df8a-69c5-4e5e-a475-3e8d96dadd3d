Physical activity is good for everyone! The good news is that if you speak
with your doctor or specialist and they say it is safe for you to be active
then there is no reason why you shouldn’t start today. But before you put on
your exercise clothes and tie up your shoelaces there are a few things you
need to keep in mind to make sure you're moving safely.

physical activity program. Make sure you ask your doctor if he/she thinks

Exercise Physiologist who can help to make sure you know how much, how often
and how hard you need to be exercising.

1. If your medication changes you need to ask your doctor how that might impact on your ability to be physically active. Sometimes medications can change how your body responds to physical activity.

against an immovable object for example wall squat, plank or stomach crunches

the best option if you have a heart condition.

9\. Aerobic and strength training activities that use large muscle groups are
great because they strengthen your heart and lungs, improve blood pressure,
10\. Walking up hills may be harder when you have a heart condition. Hills can
still be included in your workout but you may need to reduce your pace or
11\. Be sure to include a warm up and cool down to reduce the stress on the
heart and allow the body to prepare for and recover from exercise effectively.
12\. Monitor your heart rate and breathing during exercise to ensure you are
staying within your limits and not pushing yourself too hard.
13\. Stop exercising if you feel unwell, experience breathlessness or have
pressure or pain in the chest, neck, arm, jaw, or shoulder. If you experience
dizziness or become lightheaded during exercise slow exercise and then rest.
Remember everyone can exercise! Be prepared, know your limitations during
exercise and when you should stop in order to be safe.
