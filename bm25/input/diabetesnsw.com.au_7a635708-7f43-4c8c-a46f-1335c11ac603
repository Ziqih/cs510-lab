Patients with type 2 diabetes secrete not only too little insulin but also too
much glucagon, which contributes to blood glucose outside of the target range.
A new study from Sweden’s Uppsala University suggests this is because the
In healthy individuals, insulin signals the body to absorb glucose, thereby
reducing glucose in the blood and providing energy to tissues.
In patients with type 2 diabetes this mechanism fails, because the glucose-
absorbing tissues become resistant to insulin and because too little of the
hormone is released into the blood. This leads to elevated blood glucose and
Often, people living with type 2 diabetes also have elevated levels of
Glucagon counteracts the effects of insulin by instructing the liver to
After a meal, the release of glucagon is normally blocked to prevent excessive
When this fails in patients with diabetes, too much glucagon contributes to a
vicious cycle that exacerbates the already high blood glucose levels of people
Despite this vital function of glucagon, relatively little is known about how
Using advanced microscopy techniques, a team led by Omar Hmeadi in Sebastian
Barg's research group at Uppsala University has added insight into how
As expected, the experiments showed that glucagon is secreted during periods
of low glucose, while high levels of the glucose efficiently block its
However, in α-cells of people living with type 2 diabetes this regulation was
disturbed and high glucose no longer blocked the release of glucagon. To find
out why, Dr Hmeadi and colleagues isolated the α-cells and separated them from
Surprisingly, the cells now behaved in a 'diabetic' manner and continued to
The reason, Dr Hmeadi explained, is that α-cells are normally blocked by
insulin and other hormones that are released at high blood glucose from nearby
When the cells are separated from each other, this cell-to-cell communication
is lost and glucagon secretion proceeds even when it should not. But why do
the isolated α-cells behave as if they have type 2 diabetes?
It turns out that the α-cells in type 2 diabetes become resistant to insulin,
much like liver, fat and muscle. The result is that glucagon release is no
longer inhibited during the mealtime rise in blood glucose, and this leads to
the elevated levels of the hormone in type 2 diabetes.
The researchers hope that the findings will contribute to a better
understanding of human type 2 diabetes and guide the development of more
