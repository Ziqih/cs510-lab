# Gestational diabetes: care to expect before and after birth
### When you have gestational diabetes, it’s important to know what care
you’re entitled to at every stage – during pregnancy, labour, birth and after
You should expect more appointments, tests and scans than other pregnant
women. These will help make sure your pregnancy is going as smoothly as
You should also expect to be in touch with your diabetes and antenatal team
every one to two weeks throughout your pregnancy.

Your joint diabetes and antenatal team are responsible for making sure you get
the care and information you need. They should:
* Give you information on gestational diabetes and explain how it’s treated.
* Give you a blood glucose meter, teach you how to use it and decide on your blood sugar targets with you.
* Make sure you have a Maternity Exemption Certificate or Card, which will make sure you get free prescriptions.
* Explain who the different members of your healthcare team are and what they will do to help you.
* Refer you to see a dietitian to talk about your diet and physical activity.
* Tell you who to call if you need extra support.
* Explain how to treat hypos (low blood sugar) and hypers (high blood sugars).
## Get the most out of your appointments
One of the most important things you can do to make sure you have a healthy
pregnancy is to make regular appointments with your healthcare team – and go

education. You should also have the opportunity to talk with your midwife or
If you prepare a bit before you go, it’ll make all the difference:
* Decide what you need to know and make a note of a few questions, and write down points you want to talk about.
* Take things you think will be useful, like your blood sugar results – use My Blood Sugar Targets (PDF, 104KB) – or a list of your medications.
* Ask if you’ll need any tests before going to the appointment.
* Ask if you need to bring anything with you, like a urine sample.
* Listen and ask questions. Don’t be shy to ask if you don’t understand anything. 
* Take notes to help you remember what’s been said.
* Ask for your test results and what they mean. 
* Take someone with you to help with questions and remembering what’s said. 
* Make a plan with your healthcare professional about what should happen next.
* Put your next appointment in your phone calendar or diary and make a note of anything you need to do beforehand.
You’ll be advised to give birth in a hospital. That’s because it’s easier to
You should also be advised to have your labour induced, or a caesarean section
if this is the best option for you, before 41 weeks of pregnancy – if you have
not had your baby by this time. You may be advised to have your baby earlier
than this if there are complications, such as high blood pressure or a big
During labour and birth, your blood sugar levels will be monitored carefully.
If your levels aren’t between 4-7mmol/l, you may be given a drip.
After birth, you and your baby will be carefully looked after. Here's a few
* Your baby should stay with you unless the team has any concerns. If there are concerns, they may move your baby to a special unit – called a neonatal unit.
* Your baby will need to be fed soon after birth – within 30 minutes – and then every two to three hours after that.
* Your baby’s blood sugar level will be checked regularly to help stop it from going too low. 
* You and your baby will have to stay in hospital for at least 24 hours before you can go home. This is because your healthcare team will need to make sure that your baby’s sugar levels are ok and that they are feeding well.
Most women’s blood sugar levels go back to normal after labour. So, if you’re
taking diabetes medication, including insulin, it will be stopped straight
But, in some cases, pregnancy uncovers existing diabetes, so some women will
After having gestational diabetes, you’re at an increased risk of developing
it in future pregnancies, so you should be offered testing for diabetes when
planning future pregnancies. You’re also more likely to develop type 2

* Make sure your blood sugar levels are checked regularly, including a test between 6 and 13 weeks after you’ve given birth and then an annual test to check your blood sugar levels are normal. 
* Look out for the signs and symptoms of diabetes and arrange to see your GP or nurse if you’re worried. 
* During future pregnancies, tell your healthcare team that you have a history of gestational diabetes. You should be offered a blood glucose monitor to carry out early self-monitoring at home or an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). If the results from your first OGTT are normal, you should be offered a follow up test later in your pregnancy.
* Take steps to manage your weight, make healthier food choices and keep up your physical activity. This will help to reduce your risk future risk of developing gestational diabetes again or type 2 diabetes in the future.

Some women can feel down, anxious or tearful after giving birth. Your health
visitor and GP should talk with you about how you’re feeling after the birth.
If your feelings last longer than two weeks or start later, you could have

If you think you have postnatal depression, talk to your doctor, midwife or
care team straight away. They will be able to arrange care and support for
you. The earlier it’s diagnosed and treated, the quicker you’ll recover.
