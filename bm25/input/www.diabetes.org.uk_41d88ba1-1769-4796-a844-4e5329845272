>>>>>>> It was a Saturday afternoon on 21 December 2019. I was aimlessly
scrolling through my Instagram account, waiting for my fiancé to return from
work when a sponsored Swim22 post appeared. Given it was in support of
Diabetes UK, it captured my attention. I clicked the sponsored post to find
>>>>>>> Having struggled to stay committed to a form of exercise for the
previous 12 months, I figured this could be something new to try. I have had
personal trainers, I have trained weights, played tennis, kickboxing,
Brazilian jiu jitsu and attended group training sessions.
>>>>>>> Using any excuse I could find, I struggled to stay committed long
term. Although I was taught to swim in primary school, it’s not something I
have pursued since then, unless absolutely necessary. The most activity I
would do in a pool is to climb on to a lilo, usually with a drink in hand,
>>>>>>> I was interested in taking part in Swim22 as it was the perfect
opportunity for me to give something back. A decade on from diagnosis I found
myself still taking all the support I could get from Diabetes UK, never
talking openly about my condition to help or inspire others. I continued to
hide my diabetes and never taking the opportunity to give something back.
>>>>>>> The New Year was on the horizon, I had just faced the most challenging
six months of my business life and was feeling under pressure, stressed and
lacking self-worth. Unsure about what happens next I found myself in a mental
space I was not familiar with. I researched the benefits of swimming on my
physical and mental health and decided to take the plunge.

previous 12 months, I figured this could be something new to try.
>>>>>>> That was it, I am committed and I am ready. I immediately felt more
optimistic for the New Year. My fundraising target is £2,200.00. My aim is to
create as much exposure as possible so that I can become a positive advocate
>>>>>>> In my experience you'll feel so much better about yourself and your
condition or even those close to you who live with it. All too often I hear
people complaining that we still, after years do not have the tools to manage
this condition more effectively or have a cure, but the more sponsorship we
raise for Diabetes UK means more money for life changing research. I feel very
optimistic about the future care for people living with diabetes, what a time
>>>>>>> I would like to create as much exposure as possible so that I can
become a positive advocate for those living with diabetes. I want to inspire
as many diabetics as possible, as in my experience it can sometimes feel like
a very lonely, misfortunate place to be. I am hoping that by taking part in
Swim 22 I can calm my anxiety, lose weight and improve my HbA1c.
>>>>>>> I have found the fundraising pretty easy. Initially I did set a target
of around £200 then I quickly erased it as I knew I had set the bar too low. I
do believe that people are keen to help support a good cause so I knew I could
>>>>>>> With this in mind I set a much more inspiring target of £2,200. I
rolled out an initial sponsorship opportunity to a few small businesses. I was
specific in the amount they would each contribute and in return promised them
exposure via a towel (which I had made at my own expense) taken with me to
every swim, frequent mentions via my Instagram and my LinkedIn pages. I own a
small insurance brokerage firm so the businesses mentioned above and are
supporting me are in fact existing clients of mine. I limited this opportunity
to 10 companies donating £100 each, they went very quickly so that got me to

and I have asked whether they would do a raffle amongst their members offering
their own merchandise as a prize. I am sure I will continue to find new ways
and will not stop until I reach my goal.

fundraising tips. I would encourage every participant to take the time out to
