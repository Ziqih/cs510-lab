>>>>>>> How does insulin resistance increase risk of Alzheimer's disease?
>>>>>>> People with Type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing
Alzheimer’s disease, but we don’t know why. Dr Mudher believes that Type 2
diabetes could have a negative effect on a protein in the brain, called ‘Tau’.
She wants to find out more about this interaction to see if it can be stopped,
to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease in people with Type 2 diabetes.
>>>>>>> Alzheimer’s disease is a devastating condition that causes memory
loss, confusion and disorientation. Previous studies with large groups of
people with Type 2 diabetes suggest there is a connection between these two
conditions, as older people with Type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of
developing Alzheimer’s. But it’s not yet clear why.
>>>>>>> People with Type 2 diabetes experience insulin resistance, where the
cells in the body don’t respond properly to the hormone insulin. This causes
blood glucose levels to gradually rise. Dr Mudher thinks this insulin
resistance could be contributing to the development Alzheimer’s disease.
>>>>>>> Dr Mudher believes insulin resistance could influence the activity of
a protein called Tau, which stops working properly in the brains of people
with Alzheimer’s disease. Tau is altered so that it forms rope-like
structures, called ‘tangles’. Usually cells in the brain are able to remove
these tangles, but insulin resistance may stop this ‘untangling’ from
>>>>>>> Dr Mudher and her team will start by studying how the brain usually
removes Tau tangles, using fruit flies. They will then look at how insulin
might play a role in preventing the removal of Tau tangles, and see if this
>>>>>>> Finally, they will study brains donated by people with Type 2
diabetes, some of whom also had Alzheimer’s disease. This way, they can see if
their earlier discoveries in fruit flies relate to human brains. This will
help to confirm how insulin resistance could cause Tau to stay tangled in
>>>>>>> ### Potential benefit to people with diabetes
>>>>>>> This research will shed light on how Type 2 diabetes increases the
risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Understanding the connection in more detail will
help scientists to develop new therapies to slow or stop the progression of
Alzheimer’s disease in people with Type 2 diabetes. It may also help
healthcare professionals to provide the best advice on how to manage both
