Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of type 1 diabetes and,
DKA happens when your blood glucose is very high and ketones build up to
Ketoacidosis shouldn’t be confused with ketosis, which is harmless. Ketosis
can occur as a result of an extremely low carbohydrate diet, known as a
DKA only happens when you don’t have enough insulin in your body to process
It’s less common in people with type 2 diabetes because insulin levels don’t
usually drop so low; however, it can occur. DKA may be the first sign of type
1 diabetes, as people with this disease can’t make their own insulin.
Symptoms of DKA can appear quickly and may include:
* high levels of ketones in the urine
DKA is a medical emergency. Call your local emergency services immediately if
If left untreated, DKA can lead to a coma or death. If you use insulin, make
sure you discuss the risk of DKA with your healthcare team and have a plan in
People living with type 1 diabetes, you should have a supply of home urine
ketone tests. You can buy these at the pharmacy or online.
The treatment for DKA usually involves a combination of approaches to
normalize blood glucose and insulin levels. If you’re diagnosed with DKA but
haven’t yet been diagnosed with diabetes, your doctor will create a diabetes
Infection can increase the risk of DKA. If your DKA is a result of an
infection or illness, your doctor will treat that as well, usually with
At the hospital, your physician will likely give you fluids. If possible, they
can give them orally, but you may have to receive fluids through an IV. Fluid
replacement helps treat dehydration, which can cause even higher blood glucose
Insulin will likely be administered to you intravenously until your blood
glucose levels normalise. When your blood glucose levels are within an
acceptable range, your doctor will work with you to help you avoid DKA in the
When your insulin levels are too low, your body’s electrolytes can also become
abnormally low. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help your
body, including the heart and nerves, function properly. Electrolyte
replacement is also commonly done through an IV.
DKA occurs when blood glucose levels are very high and insulin levels are low.
Our bodies need insulin to use the available glucose in the blood. In DKA,
glucose can’t get into the cells, so it builds up, resulting in high blood
In response, the body starts breaking down fat into a useable fuel that
doesn’t require insulin. That fuel is called ketones. When too many ketones
build up, your blood becomes acidic. This is diabetic ketoacidosis.
* missing an insulin injection or not injecting enough insulin
* a clog in one’s insulin pump (for people who are using one)
Your risk of DKA is higher if you:
* have had some form of trauma, either emotional or physical
* have had a heart attack or stroke
Although DKA is uncommon in people who have type 2 diabetes, it can occur.
Some people with type 2 diabetes are considered “ketone prone” and are at a
higher risk of DKA. Some medications can increase the risk of DKA. Talk to
Testing for ketones in a sample of urine is one of the first steps for
diagnosing DKA. They will likely also test your blood glucose level. Other
* basic bloodwork, including potassium and sodium, to assess metabolic function
* arterial blood gas, where blood is drawn from an artery to determine its acidity
* if ill, a chest X-ray or other tests to look for signs of an infection, such as pneumonia
There are many ways to prevent DKA. One of the most important is the
* Follow your meal plan and stay hydrated with water.
* Test your blood glucose consistently. This will help you get in the habit of making sure your numbers are in range. If you notice a problem, you can talk to your doctor about adjusting your treatment plan.
Although you can’t completely avoid illness or infection, you can take steps
to help you remember to take your insulin and to help prevent and plan for a
* Set an alarm if you take it at the same time every day, or download a medication reminder app for your phone to help remind you.
* Pre-fill your syringe or syringes in the morning. That will help you easily see if you missed a dose.
* Talk to your doctor about adjusting your insulin dosage levels based on your activity level, illnesses, or other factors, such as what you’re eating.
* Develop an emergency or “sick day” plan so you will know what to do if you develop DKA symptoms.
* Test your urine for ketone levels during periods of high stress or illness. This can help you catch mild to moderate ketone levels before they threaten your health.
* Seek medical care if your blood glucose levels are higher than normal or ketones are present. Early detection is essential.
DKA is serious, but it can be prevented. Follow your treatment plan and be
proactive about your health. Tell your doctor if something isn’t working for
you or if you’re having trouble. They can adjust your treatment plan or help
you come up with solutions for better managing your diabetes.
