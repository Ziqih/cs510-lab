## Before we go through some snack ideas, ask yourself what you are looking

minerals, healthy fats etc), stabilise blood glucose levels, and satisfy your
hunger between meals. However, not everyone living with diabetes needs to have
If your doctor has prescribed blood glucose lowering oral medications (eg.
diamicron) or insulin, you may need to eat a carbohydrate-based snack between

cakes, slices, muffins, deep-fried foods, fast-food and convenience meals that
include cream or cheese-based sauces and fillings. These foods fill us up and
are enjoyable. However if over-consumed these foods and drinks can lead to
eating less of the healthier foods from the five core food groups (foods which
bring in all the fibres, vitamins, minerals etc essential to a healthy body
and mind) leaving you feeling tired, malnourished and possibly constipated.
