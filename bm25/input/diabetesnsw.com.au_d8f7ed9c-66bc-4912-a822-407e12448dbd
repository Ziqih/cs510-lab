The start of a new year brings the tradition of new year’s resolutions. While
they can be a great way to get us motivated, they can also be a cause of
disappointment if we set goals that are unrealistic. Given the challenges of
2020, we recommend aiming for achievable and fun resolutions in 2021.
##**Make a plan and keep it simple to begin with**
When looking at the year ahead, instead of planning 101 things to achieve in a
short period of time, you could choose just one activity (one that includes
some physical activity is ideal) and commit to doing it once per month. This
could be a visit to a beach you've always wanted to go to or trialling a new
exercise class (many offer the first class for free). By the end of the year
you will have experienced 12 new beaches or maybe found a new activity that
you really enjoy. By making your goal time-realistic you will be setting
The beginning of a new year brings a wealth of health and fitness deals,
including memberships, equipment and gadgets. But will that purchase really be
the sure-fire way to get you healthy and fit? If there is one thing we have
learnt from 2020, it is that exercise really can be done anywhere and there is
almost always an alternative option to gym equipment. All you need is a little
imagination. If you are stuck for ideas, try calling our experienced exercise
physiologists at our Contact Centre on 1300 342 238 or try visiting the
Exercise Right website for some home workout ideas.
If you haven’t given our Beat It program a go yet, maybe this is the year to
try it out? It is a free 8-week exercise program incorporating exercise and
education for those living with diabetes. You can read more about it here.
##**Set goals that are FUN to achieve and include friends**
Goals that are centred around physical activity and fitness don’t have to just
be for the marathon runner out there. Do you like to walk? Why not enter your
first ‘event walk’. The good thing about these events are that most offer
different distances to complete and are often associated with a great
charitable cause. Getting involved in something with a friend or partner is
always more fun and helps keep you accountable.
Diabetes NSW & ACT regularly runs the Great Ocean Road Trek as a fundraising
event for our community. It is definitely a challenge but it is also
incredibly fulfilling. However, with Covid restrictions changing all the time,
this year we have launched an additional virtual event. While the physical
event is still scheduled for the end of May for those that are very fit and
able to travel, the virtual event will provide an alternative for those
preferring to stay in their local area to meet the challenge. The event is
free to enter and everyone who raises over $50 receives a t-shirt. There are
great prizes up for grabs for the top fundraisers. Funds raised provide
advocacy support and psychological care for people living with diabetes, and
assist in the search for better treatments and a cure. You can find out more
