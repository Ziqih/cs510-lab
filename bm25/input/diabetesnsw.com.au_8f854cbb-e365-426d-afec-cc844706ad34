# Maximise your fun AND stay fit this Christmas
As we approach the festive season, our calendars start to fill with Christmas
Often, we enjoy food and drinks that are higher in energy and our exercise
regime goes by the wayside. But it doesn’t have to be this way! We can still
enjoy the festivities, maintain regular physical activity and stay fit this
If we’re eating and drinking more than usual, it becomes even more important
to dedicate time to being physically active. This can be achieved in many
different ways. The warmer weather brings about great conditions for getting
out in the garden or completing DIY projects.
Perhaps you like being by the water and can enjoy a spot of swimming, fishing,
kayaking or walks along the beach or river. Bike riding, walking and other
recreational activities can still be enjoyed during this time.
You just need to prioritise them like any other appointment.
### Keep moving even when you're waiting for the kettle
There are also opportunities for us to increase our incidental activity and
While you’re waiting for the kettle to boil each morning, you could be
completing some wall push ups or calf raises.
You could space out your household tasks (ie, washing, vacuuming, dusting,
window cleaning, mowing, gardening) across the week so you can be active on
most days. By making the conscious decision to be more physically active,
you’ll be increasing your total steps per day and energy expenditure.
By maintaining a regular exercise regime, you’ll be able to manage your blood
glucose levels (BGLs) more consistently, with fewer highs and lows.
Remember, if your blood glucose levels do go high (greater than 15mmol/L), you
should refer to your sick day management plan or visit your GP as appropriate.
You might be required to check your blood glucose levels more frequently if
they are consistently high, and maintain adequate hydration and regular eating
### Top tips for staying fits and active this Christmas
Some other top tips for keeping active during the festive season include:
* Increase your overall step count each day by scheduling in short bouts of exercise
* Make social catch ups with friends and family active – take a stroll through the local Christmas market or have a picnic in the park
* Unleash your inner child and partake in physical activities with your kids or grandchildren - perhaps using the new basketball or cricket set they received for Christmas
* Make use of a quiet gym if you have a membership. Often December and January arethe quietest period
* Try or learn something new such as yoga, tai chi or pilates
Wishing you all an active, healthy and safe Christmas and New Year!
