More and more people are choosing to follow a vegetarian diet for many
different reasons. It’s estimated that two per cent of the population now
Reasons for switching to a vegetarian diet include:
* taste – some people just don’t like the taste of meat or fish.
A vegetarian diet, based on unprocessed foods, can provide many health
benefits for us all, whether or not you have diabetes.
If you have diabetes, it’s important to be more aware of how what you eat
affects your body and, in turn, you’ll hopefully become more health conscious.
So what is a vegetarian diet? Are there any ways it could help manage
diabetes? Does it provide any health benefits for people with diabetes?
According to the Vegetarian Society, a vegetarian is:
"Someone who lives on a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and
fruits with, or without, the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does
not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or by-products of slaughter."
* Lacto-ovo-vegetarians eat both dairy products and eggs (usually free range).
* Lacto-vegetarians eat dairy products, but avoid eggs.
* Vegans do not any products derived from animals – no meat, fish, dairy or eggs.
Plant-based foods, particularly fruit and vegetables, nuts, pulses and seeds
have been shown to help in the treatment of many chronic diseases and are
often associated with lower rates of Type 2 diabetes, less hypertension, lower
These foods are also higher in fibre, antioxidants, folate and phytochemicals,
which are all good for our general health.
Vegetarian diets have been shown to be beneficial for people with Type 2
diabetes where weight loss is often the most effective way to manage the
condition. A wholefood vegetarian diet often contains fewer calories and can
help you to maintain a healthy body weight.
It is important to keep an eye on portions sizes of high-fat foods such as
cheese and nuts or you might find yourself putting on weight. With the
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in people with diabetes,
keeping your weight under control and reducing blood pressure and blood
cholesterol are all essential and plant-based foods can help with these.
Vegetarians who eat dairy products and eggs will have a good protein intake.
If you are a vegan, there are also many plant-based protein sources that can
help you to meet your protein requirements. These include:
nuts, seeds and their butters, eg cashew, peanut, almond, brazil, tahini
* beans and pulses, eg butter beans, chickpeas, lentils
* soya products, eg tofu, soya cheese, soya milk.
### Can I replace the animal protein (meat/fish) in my diet with more carbs?
It is better to replace animal protein with non-animal sources of protein.
There is generally more carbohydrate in plant-based protein sources, so it is
possible that your carbohydrate intake may increase when you switch to a
vegetarian diet. However, you can still watch your portions, and always look
for lowglycaemic index (GI)options and pick foods that are high in fibre.
Doing this could help in managing diabetes and with weight control. The GI is
a measure of how quickly carbohydrate is absorbed and the quicker the
### How can I lose weight if I’m a vegetarian?
Following a vegetarian diet can be healthy, but if you simply replace meat and
fish with processed foods, which can be high in calories and low in vitamins
and minerals, eg ready meals, pastries, pies, takeaways, cheese, creamy sauces
and dips, your diet may be unbalanced and you’re likely to put on weight. That
is why it is important to replace such high-fat foods like these with cottage
cheese, eggs, dishes based around beans, tomato-based sauces, and nuts and
seeds in moderation, and fill up on vegetables served with wholegrain rice,
pasta or bread. It is extremely important to watch your overall portions.
Keeping active is also important for weight management.
### How can I get enough calcium and iron?
There’s plenty of calcium in dairy products and it’s also found in cereals and
cereal products, green leafy vegetables, nuts and pulses, eg baked beans and
dried lentils. Meat is rich in iron, but there are also vegetarian sources of
Consuming more fruit and vegetables can also help as they are high in vitamin
C, which increases the amount of iron your body absorbs.
### Will a vegetarian diet control my cholesterol levels?
Saturated fat has been linked with raised cholesterol levels and is mainly
found in animal foods and processed foods. Therefore, replacing meat with
cheese is unlikely to reduce your saturated fat intake or your cholesterol
levels, so if you’re eating dairy foods choose reduced-fat versions, eg
cottage cheese, quark, skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, and lower-fat/lower-sugar
Fibre is important for gut health but is also associated with reduced risk of
some chronic diseases, including heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and some
cancers. There are two different types of fibre, soluble and insoluble, and
most foods contain a mixture of both. Both are valuable to health. Insoluble
fibre adds bulk to stools and helps them pass through the gut effectively
whereas soluble fibre helps control blood glucose levels and reduces
cholesterol. Foods such as wholegrains, fruit and vegetables, pulses, nuts and
seeds have a good mix of soluble and insoluble fibre so include these options
A vegetarian diet can provide all the nutrients you need for good health. The
only exception to this is vitamin B12, which vegetarians can obtain from eggs
and dairy foods. The only reliable sources for vegans are fortified foods such
as non-dairy milks, yeast extracts and breakfast cereals. Alternatively a
Specific nutritional supplements may also be considered for people who are
particularly at risk of deficiencies, for example elderly people, infants and
children. Speak to your doctor if you think you may be at risk of any nutrient
### Shouldn’t I be eating fish for omega-3 fatty acids?
There is evidence to suggest that people with diabetes may benefit from
omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish, which are useful in the prevention and
treatment of heart disease. But vegetarians can make sure they get adequate
sources of this fatty acid in their diet by including omega-3 enriched eggs,
flaxseed and rapeseed oil, walnuts, soya-based foods such as soya milk, and
tofu and walnuts. These sources are not as good as oily fish, so it is
important to include them on a regular basis in order to get adequate amounts
### Is it expensive to be a vegetarian?
A vegetarian diet doesn’t have to be more expensive and may even be cheaper!
Dried foods such as beans, peas, quinoa, lentils and rice can be very
inexpensive and go a long way. It’s often cheaper to buy in bulk and these
foods can be stored a long time. Look out for special offers, try buying fresh
fruit and veg from your local market and have a go at batch cooking and
