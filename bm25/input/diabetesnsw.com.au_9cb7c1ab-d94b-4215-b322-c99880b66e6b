# Staying active at home is important – here’s how
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has brought many changes to our lives
including the requirement to stay at home. But while we're at home many of us
aren’t staying active and moving as much as we normally would.
That’s because we’re getting less of the “incidental exercise” we’d normally
get from going about our day-to-day activities, and many of our routine
While we don’t know for sure how long our lifestyles will be affected in this
way, we do know periods of reduced physical activity can affect our health.
This places older people and those with chronic conditions like type 2
To understand why the consequences of inactivity could be worse for some
people, it’s first important to understand the concept of cardiorespiratory
Cardiorespiratory fitness provides an indication of our overall health. It
tells us how effectively different systems in our body are working together,
for example how the lungs and heart transport oxygen to the muscles during
The amount of physical activity we do influences our cardiorespiratory
fitness, along with our age. Cardiorespiratory fitness generally peaks in our
20s and then steadily declines as we get older. If we’re inactive, our
As we get older, our cardiorespiratory fitness declines.
One study looked at five young healthy men who were confined to bed rest for
three weeks. On average, their cardiorespiratory fitness decreased 27% over
These same men were tested 30 years later. Notably, three decades of normal
ageing had less effect on cardiorespiratory fitness (11% reduction) than three
This study demonstrates even relatively short periods of inactivity can
But the news isn’t all bad. Resuming physical activity after periods of
inactivity can restore cardiorespiratory fitness, while being physically
active can slow the decline in cardiorespiratory fitness associated with
Generally, older people and those who live with chronic conditions (like heart
disease or type 2 diabetes) have lower cardiorespiratory fitness compared to
This can increase the risk of health issues like developing another heart
While we’ve been encouraged to stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s
still possible for this group to remain physically active. Here are some tips:
1. Set a regular time to exercise each day – when you wake up, before lunch or in the afternoon so it becomes routine.
2. Aim to do 30 minutes of exercise on most days. It doesn’t have to all be done at once and can be spread across the day (for example, in three ten-minute sessions)
3. Use your phone to track your activity. See how many steps you do in a “typical” day during social distancing, then try to increase that number by 100 steps per day.
4. Take any opportunity to add activity to your day. Take the stairs if you can, or walk around the house while talking on the phone.
5. Minimise periods of sitting by getting up and moving every 30 minutes. For example during the TV ad breaks.
6. Incorporate additional activity into your day through housework and gardening.
