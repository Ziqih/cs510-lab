Ramadan is the month-long fast that takes place in the ninth month of the
Islamic lunar calendar each year. It is one of the five pillars of Islam. It
takes place during daylight hours and is compulsory for all healthy Muslims
who have reached puberty. However, there are exceptions to this. Certain
groups of people, such as people with diabetes, are exempt. However many
people still choose to fast for religious, social and cultural reasons.
Studies have shown that as much as 40% of people with type 1 diabetes and
around 80% or those with type 2 diabetes will fast during the Holy Month; this
adds up to over 115 million people worldwide!
It is a personal choice whether or not you fast. If you do choose to fast,
then you must talk to your doctor or diabetes educator first, to make sure
that you know how to look after yourself. Fasting can be dangerous if you have
diabetes as it can cause health issues, and this would be contrary to the
Qur’an, which states that you must not act in a way that harms your body (Al
When we eat, carbohydrates are broken down to glucose and insulin is produced
to store the glucose into the liver and muscles.
When we don’t eat for a while, some of this stored glucose in released back
into the blood stream with the help of glucagon (another hormone which acts
like the antidote to insulin). During long periods of fasting, such as during
Ramadan, the blood glucose levels may drop as glucose stores in the body are
used up. This can cause hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels).
You may develop high blood glucose levels during a fast if you do not take
your prescribed medication or if you are less physically active than normal.
Large meals at suhur (the dawn meal) and iftar (breaking of the fast) can
Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are the most common risk factors for people
If you have compilations associated with diabetes, such as heart disease,
kidney disease or visual problems, the risk of these issues becoming worse
during the fast is high, and so you should consider to not fast.
Not drinking any fluids during the day, when you fast can cause dehydration.
If you are a person who sweats easily or if you have excessive perspiration
due to hard, physical labour, this could get worse quickly. Hot and humid
climates, such as during Australian summers, are another risk factor, or if
your blood glucose levels are high this can further contribute to dehydration
and may increase the risk of thrombosis and stroke.
Most often the medical recommendation is not to fast. However, many Muslims
with diabetes are passionate about fasting. They enjoy the spiritual
atmosphere during Ramadan, don’t think of themselves as being sick and don’t
want to miss out. If you choose to fast it is important to talk to your doctor
You will have to be prepared to break your fast if your blood glucose levels
drop below 3.9 mmol/L or rise above 16 mmol/L, to prevent symptoms of
It is important to check blood glucose levels more regularly during Ramadan.
Checking blood glucose levels will not break your fast, as there is only a
* Never skip suhoor. Long hours without eating increase the risk of hypoglycaemia and it will be much easier to balance your blood glucose levels throughout the fast if you eat a meal at suhoor.
* Try to eat moderate portion sizes - remember that Ramadan is also about self-control and discipline
* Include fruit and vegetables at both suhoor and iftar
* Limit fried or fatty foods. They will make you put on weight, raise your blood glucose levels and make them more difficult to control
* Limit the intake of salty foods to reduce the risk of dehydration
* Drink plenty of sugar-free fluids, particularly water, at suhoor and after iftar to replenish fluid loss during the day
* Limit your intake of high sugary foods (such as dates or juice, often used to break the fast)
* Ask to see a dietitian who’ll be able to give you more advice about healthy eating.
Supper after tarawih can be taken as a replacement of a pre-bed snack.
You can continue to do your normal physical activity. However excessive
physical activity should be avoided as this can increase your risk of
hypoglycaemia, particularly during the few hours before the sunset meal.
In some patients with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes, exercise may lead to
Taraweeh (multiple prayers performed after the sunset meal which involve
repeated cycles of rising, kneeling, and bowing) should be considered a part
of the daily exercise program. Taraweeh can be a tiring activity and you could
become dehydrated or be at risk of hypos. To avoid problems during Taraweeh,
* Eat starchy foods with iftar as they are digested slowly
* Take a bottle of water and glucose treatment with you to taraweeh.
Although most diabetes medications require no adjustments, some tablets may
need to be switched from the morning to the sunset meal. Some medications need
to be stopped or changed to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia. Medications
that you usually take three times per day may need to be adjusted so you only
need to take them twice per day during the fast.
 _You should always seek advice from your doctor **prior** to Ramadan in
regards to any medication changes that may be needed._
Basal (sometimes also called background insulin, long or intermediate-acting)
insulin doses may need to be reduced by around 15-30%. It is best taken after
Bolus (mealtime, rapid or short-acting) insulin doses should not be taken at
lunchtime. The suhoor dosage may need to be reduced by around 25-50%. Usually
the regular bolus dosage can be continued at iftar, provided you have a
similar sized meal as you would usually have at dinner.
If you take premixed insulin once daily the dosage can be taken at iftar. For
those taking twice daily premixed insulin, the suhur dosage will need to be
reduced by around 25-50%. If you are usually on three lots of premixed insulin
at main meals, the lunchtime one should not be taken. The iftar and suhoor
If you have type 1 diabetes and you are on an insulin pump, generally the
basal rates will need to be reduced by 20-40% in the last three to four hours
of fasting. You should increase your basal rates by up to 30% after iftar.
Normal carbohydrate counting and insulin sensitivity principles apply in
regards to bolus doses at both suhoor and iftar.
Of course the above medication and insulin dose adjustment recommendations are
a guideline only. _You should always seek advice from your doctor **prior** to
Ramadan in regards to any medication changes that may be needed._
