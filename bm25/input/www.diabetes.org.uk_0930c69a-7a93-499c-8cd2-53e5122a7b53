# Number of people with diabetes reaches 4.8 million
Diabetes is on the rise, with 5.3 million expected to be living with the
condition by 2025. Our findings also show that people with type 2 diabetes are
3.9 million people are currently living with a diagnosis of diabetes, and 90%
of those with type 2. In addition, there are almost a million more people
living with type 2 diabetes who don’t know they have it because they haven’t
been diagnosed yet, bringing the total number up to more than 4.8 million.
Our data shows a stark increase in the number of people living with a diabetes
diagnosis in the UK of more than 100,000 from last year. At this rate the
number of people with diabetes, including the undiagnosed population, is
expected to rise to 5.3 million by 2025.
People with type 2 diabetes are 50% more likely to die prematurely than those
without diabetes. A common complication of diabetes that can lead to early
death is heart disease. People with type 2 diabetes are also two to two-and-a-
half times more likely to experience heart failure and twice more likely to
have a heart attack compared to people without diabetes.
Age, family history, and ethnicity can contribute to someone’s risk, with
people of African-Caribbean, Black African or South Asian descent two to four
times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than white people.
The single greatest risk factor, however, is obesity. While not every case of
type 2 diabetes is associated with excessive weight, it is responsible for 80
to 85% of someone’s risk of developing the condition.
Obesity in England has almost doubled in the last 20 years from 6.9 to 13
million, yet Government action to tackle obesity appears to have stalled.
Under both Theresa May and Boris Johnson the Government has consistently
failed to publish the results of numerous consultations on the matter.
We are calling on the Government to honour their manifesto commitment to
tackle childhood obesity and make it a top priority to take decisive action in
We are also calling on the Government and NHS England to continue their focus
on preventing devastating complications, through better care for all people
