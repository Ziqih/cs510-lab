2. Add the mushrooms and minced beef and stir for 4-5 minutes breaking up any clumps of meat with a wooden spoon.
3. Add the diced carrot and sweet potato, sprinkle with the flour and mix well. Stir in the tomato puree, pepper and thyme.
4. Stir in the stock, bring to the boil, cover with the pan lid, reduce the heat and simmer for 12-15 minutes until the carrots are tender. Add the peas, stir and place the mixture in an ovenproof dish.
5. Spray a little oil onto the filo sheets and put slightly ‘scrunched’ layers on top of the beef mixture.
6. Bake for 10 minutes until the pastry is lightly browned. Serve with steamed carrots, corn and broccoli.
* You could use any mince, such as turkey, or meat alternative (e.g. soya) for this dish.
* For a gluten-free version, use gluten-free flour to thicken the sauce and top with very thinly sliced sweet potato rather than the filo. You'll need to increase the cooking time to 15 minutes.
