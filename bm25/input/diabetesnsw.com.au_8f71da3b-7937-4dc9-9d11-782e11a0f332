Everyone knows smoking, consuming too much sugar and drinking too much alcohol
will harm our long-term health – but many of us do these things anyway. Why?
Of course, we may simply decide not to worry about the negative consequences
and engage in these activities because they give us pleasure. But sometimes we
do care about the potential outcomes enough to want to stop indulging, and
still find it hard to do so. Why do so many of us struggle to forgo the extra
cookie even after we’ve decided to go on a diet?
People tend to value potential future rewards less than similar immediate
rewards when they must choose between them. Psychologists and economists call
A body of research has revealed those more prone to delay discounting are also
more prone to poor health as a result of obesity and addiction, and have a
Delay discounting tasks assess something similar to the iconic “marshmallow
test” for young children. Participants are given a single marshmallow and told
if they can wait for the experimenter to come back later without having eaten
the marshmallow, then they will get a second one.
The degree to which a child is prepared to wait for the second marshmallow has
been found to predict subsequent health outcomes, including their adult body
mass index. Waiting also predicts later achievements at school, university and
on diverse other measures of “success” even decades later in life.
Young children struggle to delay their gratification. The tendency to wait for
the second marshmallow in childhood predicts later health outcomes.
Discounting future rewards is not unique to humans, which suggests deep
evolutionary origins of our general tendency towards immediacy. One ultimate
reason for this is the future is inherently uncertain: the only guaranteed
food reward in nature is the one already in your mouth. Someone else might
pluck the fruit for which you had been waiting patiently to ripen, or some
Recent findings suggest people who have been exposed to natural disasters,
violence and death discount future rewards more. Presumably that’s because
these events reinforce the notion that the future is volatile.
In one study, children were less likely to wait for the larger reward in the
marshmallow test when the experimenter administering it had broken an earlier
promise. On a fundamental level, then, we may be prone to present
gratification because we cannot trust the future will play out how we might
Nonetheless, people can be remarkably patient in some circumstances. Think of
the time and effort so many of us invest to get advanced training or to save
for retirement – many even restrain themselves in the hope of reward in an
One of our most powerful psychological traits is our capacity to imagine
future events – to create mental scenarios of what could happen if, for
instance, we were to make different decisions. This ability, quite possibly
unique to human beings, may be one of the keys to why we can pursue specific
future outcomes for which there is no current reward, such as when we choose
to take an aspirin each day to prevent a future heart attack.
The capacity to consider future possibilities and care about our remote well-
being is highly complex. It requires the maturation of sophisticated mental
Imagining the benefits of delaying our gratification in the present gives us a
sense of the eventual – often more important – later consequences. In this
way, the imagined events can act as their own mini-reinforcements en route to
For instance, we might foresee what it could feel like to go on a hike
tomorrow with a hangover and find imagining a sober version of the experience
more rewarding: motivating us to forgo the extra beer tonight.
While adults have the basic cognitive ability to consider the future, we do
not always imagine ourselves in the relevant future situations when we make
decisions. When we do travel virtually in time and mentally pre-experience how
good or bad our current behaviour might make us feel at a future point, we
A wealth of recent research suggests having people take a few moments to
imagine their personal future while they make choices between immediate and
delayed rewards can curb their short-term preferences. Similar studies suggest
thinking about the future can ameliorate impulsive eating, cigarette smoking
Even if these manipulations are simply priming people to focus more on the
future, the studies demonstrate thinking about future consequences can shift
Due to the considerable effort invested in public health campaigns, most
people are now aware of the future ills that come hand in hand with many of
our immediate pleasures. Our tendency to discount the future makes it
difficult to translate this knowledge into more prudent behaviour. But our
preferences are malleable, and imagining the future outcomes of our current
behaviour might just help us turn our knowledge and intentions into real-world
