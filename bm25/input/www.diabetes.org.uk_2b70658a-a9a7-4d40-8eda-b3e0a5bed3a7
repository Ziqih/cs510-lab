### If you’re thinking about using an insulin pump to treat your Type 1
diabetes, we have loads of information and the criteria you’ll need to help
you find out if it’s right for you.
We’ll explain the different types of pumps you can get, the pros and cons of
this technology, and how to get an insulin pump on the NHS. Pumps are only
An insulin pump is a small electronic device that gives your body the regular
insulin it needs throughout the day and night.
Both are attached to your body by a tiny tube called a cannula, which goes
just under your skin. You’ll need to learn how to change the cannula yourself,
You need to change your cannula every two or three days and make sure you move
to a different place every time you change it. This is really important
because you can develop lipohypertrophy, which is where your body forms hard
lumps that stop insulin working properly. You should also change sites to stop
itching and rashes that form if you stick with the same site for too long.
A tethered pump is attached to your body by another small tube that connects
The pump itself usually has all the controls on it and can be carried on your
belt, in a pocket, or in a body band. You can wear it under your clothes if
you don’t want it to be on show.
Tethered pumps can be different in things like colour, screen size and some
You attach patch pumps directly on to your body where you’ve chosen to place
your cannula. People tend put them on their legs, arms or stomachs.
Patch pumps have no extra tubing, which means the pump sits directly on your
skin and it works by using a remote.
Unlike a tethered pump, patch pumps are disposable. You’ll need to change the
whole device when the pump alerts you, not just the infusion set and location.
Your healthcare team will talk with you about the pump they think will work
best for you, or which one you can get on the NHS.
To get a pump for free, you’ll have to meet certain criteria set by the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE for short).
If you live in England and Wales, you’re over 12 years old and have Type 1
diabetes, you need to meet one or more of the following criteria:
* You can’t get to your target HbA1c without severe hypos. 
* Your HbA1c remains high despite carefully trying to manage your diabetes. 
If you live in Scotland or Northern Ireland, the criteria is different. Your
healthcare team will give you advice on whether you meet your local criteria
for getting a pump and what the next steps are.
If you’re thinking about an insulin pump for your child, the criteria is
different. Pumps are recommended for children under 12 when multiple daily
insulin injections aren’t practical or appropriate. Make sure you speak to
your diabetes specialist about if this is the best option for your child.
We understand that trying to get an insulin pump can be very frustrating, and
you might feel disappointed if you can’t get one. If you have any questions at
all, or you just need someone to talk to, call our helpline.
Pumps are currently not available for people with Type 2 on prescription. You
can self-fund, but make sure you have a discussion with your healthcare
## **How much does an insulin pump cost?**
If you meet the criteria for a pump, you should be able to get your pump on
If you don’t meet the criteria, they cost around £2000 to £3000 and should
last between 4 to 8 years. This is a lot of money, and is a big commitment. If
you want to talk to us about your options then give our helpline a call. But
remember to speak to your healthcare team too.
It’s important to remember that you’ll also have to buy other things that make
the pump work, like your infusion set. These cost around £1500 a year. This
doesn’t include your prescription insulin, which you get for free.
## **Pros and cons of an insulin pump**
Diabetes technology isn’t right for everyone. Here we’ll take you through the
pros and cons of having an insulin pump, so you’ve got all the information you

You'll need to have your pump attached to you all the time. Only take it off
for small breaks, like when you're swimming or showering.

When we talk about treating diabetes, we talk about two different types of
insulin doses, which are basal and bolus. We’re going to explain what these
Bolus insulin is a rapid-acting insulin. You take a bolus dose when you eat or
if you need to give yourself a correction dose if your levels go high.
Most pumps have bolus calculators to help you figure out the right amount of
Basal insulin, also known as background insulin, is the insulin that your pump
gives you continuously throughout the day and night.
This is usually a small amount and can be changed depending on things like the
time of day and how active you’re being. Your healthcare team will help you
set your basal rates based on your individual needs.
## **Help and support with your insulin pump**
You should get pump training and ongoing support from your diabetes healthcare
Pump manufacturers also give support if you need help with the technology or
if it breaks, and most have helplines you can call if you’re struggling.
