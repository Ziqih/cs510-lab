>>>>>>> # Kaja's story: being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at university
>>>>>>> #### Kaja was diagnosed in first year uni.
>>>>>>>> I went from a carefree fresher to being sat down in a hospital and
told I had type 1 diabetes, which was a condition I knew barely anything
>>>>>>> Kaja was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes towards the end of her first
term at university, after a bout of suspected freshers' flu.
>>>>>>> Kaja shares experiences aboutDiagnosisLife with diabetesJourney with
>>>>>>> I’d been losing weight, which I put down to not eating properly, and
feeling unwell, which I put down to freshers’ flu. I didn’t have an
explanation for my extreme thirst or needing the toilet all the time.
>>>>>>> A diabetes diagnosis isn't the sort of thing you expect to happen in
your first term of uni. It was a big shock to my new friends as well, although
they were glad that I finally knew why I'd been feeling unwell.
>>>>>>> My mum immediately started researching the condition and my brother
helped me stay positive and wasn't afraid to ask questions.
>>>>>>> The first few months after diagnosis were definitely the hardest. I
spent my Christmas holidays revising for my January exams, which was stressful
enough without having to also learn about diabetes.
>>>>>>> It was the first time I’d been really independent from my parents and
I felt very alone. It was a huge shock to my family too.
>>>>>>> * Care and support: How we help
>>>>>>> Being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at university was definitely a
daunting and upsetting experience, but over time I've learnt not to let it get
>>>>>>> It does still throw up challenges and the odd awkward moment. There’s
always someone who stares while you’re testing your blood sugar before the
>>>>>>> I also had a bit of a nightmare once where my finger wouldn’t stop
bleeding after a blood sugar test in an exam and I got blood on my exam
booklet. An assistant gave me a new booklet, and once the exam was over I saw
>>>>>>> I was worried that diabetes might stop me from enjoying the social
side of university. It took me a while to figure out what worked for me and
there were a few nights where I did have a hypo.
>>>>>>> Luckily my friends are really supportive and are there when I need
them – whether it’s helping me test on a night out, or setting a bouncer
straight who mistakes my hypo for being drunk.
>>>>>>> I've now started my second year of university and although it can
still be difficult to manage diabetes, I genuinely don't see myself as being
at a disadvantage compared to my peers. I'm determined to not let it hold me
back as I continue to enjoy my university life.
>>>>>>> ###Laura on being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes
>>>>>>> "She made me feel normal, when my normal had completely changed"
>>>>>>> I felt uncomfortable when people used to look at me at first, but then
realised they probably have no idea about diabetes, just like me before
>>>>>>> After my diagnosis, I decided to move from a catered hall into self-
catered accommodation. I found it easier to get to grips with carb counting
when I was cooking my own meals and knew exactly what went into them.
>>>>>>> There was a long waiting list for accommodation transfers, but once I
explained my situation I was bumped to the top of the list and moved in almost
immediately. I was also given a mini fridge in my room to store my insulin.
>>>>>>> One of my first hypos was 20 minutes before an exam. I had jelly
babies and was able to raise my blood sugar to a safe level but didn’t feel
100% throughout the exam, as is normal for a hypo. I finished the exam and
ended up applying for extenuating circumstances. I had planned to do this
anyway because of missing so many lectures in my first term due to illness.
>>>>>>> My lecturers were really understanding if I ever needed to eat in a
lecture or leave for a few minutes because I was feeling unwell. I also had
the option to resit my exams without it affecting my final grade. I didn't end
up needing to resit anyway as I was pleased to get a 2:1 for my first year,
but it was good to know I had that option.
>>>>>>> I would definitely recommend talking to your university about your
type 1 and how it might affect you at university. I found that they were
