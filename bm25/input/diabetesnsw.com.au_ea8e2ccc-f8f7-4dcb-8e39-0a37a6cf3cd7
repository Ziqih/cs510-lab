Diabetes in Schools is an information and training program designed for
families, schools and school staff to help them support students with type 1
diabetes to manage their condition while at school.
There are around 11,000 children and young people with diabetes attending
schools in Australia. Type 1 diabetes often requires round-the-clock
management, support and care. This includes intensive management with multiple
daily injections of insulin or insulin pump therapy, combined with regular
monitoring of blood glucose levels throughout the day.

easier for teachers and staff to support children with type 1 diabetes and

The program includes new information and tools to better support parents and
families and school principals; as well as a targeted, nationally consistent

This training covers the support and management of students with type 1
diabetes in schools including insulin administration, hypoglycaemia management
and normalising type 1 diabetes management in schools.

The program has been developed following extensive stakeholder consultation
over the last 18 months, with input from several advisory groups made up of
paediatric diabetes clinicians, principals, teachers, school staff, school
nurses and parents. The program has the support of all major diabetes health
and consumer groups including the Australian Diabetes Educators Association,
Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group
and Australian Diabetes Society. Diabetes Australia has also consulted with

***Level 1 Introductory training** is designed for all school staff and provides basic information about supporting students living with type 1 diabetes while at school. The training includes three short online modules. It’s recommended all staff undertake level 1 training.
***Level 2 Intermediate training** is available for staff who volunteer to be directly involved in supporting students with type 1 diabetes. Staff also need to be designated by a principal. Training is available via nine online modules (for all schools) or via group education workshops (in some States). Training covers type 1 diabetes and food, monitoring glucose levels, insulin, managing lows and highs, physical activity, school camps and planning for changes. Training is general and is not specific to the needs of individual students.
***Level 3 Individualised skills training –** designed for designated school staff and focuses on the individual student’s type 1 diabetes management. This practical face-to-face training is delivered in the school by a qualified health professional (where possible this will be a member of this student’s diabetes treating team). This service will begin in some states from March 2020 and will be prioritised for schools with students who are newly diagnosed and who are unable to self-administer insulin.
A new web portal will host the online training videos and learning materials,
as well as additional information, resources and tools to support principals,
school staff and parents better manage diabetes in a school context. The
portal also includes links to range of existing education materials, policies,
guidelines and resources designed to support students with type 1 diabetes The
portal will be launched tomorrow on Thursday 13th Feb 2020 and we will
commence a broader communications and engagement strategy to the education and
health sectors in the following weeks and months.
Face-to-face practical training provided by qualified healthcare professionals
(Level 3 training) will begin in some states in early March 2020. Level 3
training will be prioritised for schools with students where there is a high
need. For example, students with newly diagnosed diabetes or students who
cannot administer insulin. Level 3 training must be requested by a school
