Wearing the right footwear plays an important role in the prevention of wounds
or ulcers in the feet. Ensure your shoes do not cause foot problems - they
should be professionally fitted and broken in slowly. Check both feet
carefully after wear for blisters or skin irritations. If there is nerve
damage in the feet, you should check your shoes inside for torn linings or
sharp objects before putting them on. Shoes which do not fit properly or have
been known to cause tissue damage or injury should be avoided. Any signs of
infection or skin breakdown should be assessed by your GP or podiatrist.

soled socks may be useful as they can alert you if you have a wound that is
bleeding. Check out the socks in-store at diabetesshop.com.
If you are living with diabetes you are entitled to five subsidised visits per
calendar year to an allied health professional, such as a podiatrist. If you
look after your diabetes with exercise and diet you should see a podiatrist
once or twice a year. For those using medication three times a year is
recommended. If you have lost feeling or circulation in your feet through
arterial disease it is important to see a podiatrist as often as every six
