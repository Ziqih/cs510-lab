## What’s the link between diabetes and gum disease?
Gum disease is very common and most people will get it at least once in their
life. But when you have diabetes, you’re more at risk.

dental problems than people who don’t have diabetes. People with Type 1
One of the most common causes is having high blood sugar levels for a long
period of time. Too much sugar in your blood can lead to more sugar in your
saliva, and that’s the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. This bacteria
produces acid which attacks your tooth enamel and damages your gums.
High blood sugar levels can also damage the blood vessels in your gums and

Looking after your teeth and gums should be a basic part of how you manage
your diabetes. Because you can prevent these potential complications or spot
them early enough to get the right treatment from your dentist. We’ve got
information on how to keep your mouth healthy – a big part of this is about
regularly checking your blood sugars and trying to keep to your target range.
Mouth problems linked to your diabetes can mean:
* infection in the soft tissue and bone that support the teeth (periodontitis)
* irritated and sore mouth, meaning you might have difficulty wearing dentures
The early signs of mouth problems are things like redness, soreness and bad
breath. If you notice these, don’t ignore them and make an appointment with
your dentist. Getting the right treatment early can prevent severe infections,
tooth loss and other complications down the road.
Here’s what you need to think about to protect your teeth and gums:
* Check your blood sugars – regularly check them and try to keep in your target range.
* Brush twice a day – keep the plaque off by brushing your teeth regularly and flossing too.
* See your dentist – having diabetes doesn’t mean you get free dental treatment but you need to book regular check-ups.
* Choose the right food and drink – follow a healthy, balanced diet which is low in sugar.
* Don’t smoke – smoking weakens your immune system, making it harder for you to fight a gum infection. And once you have gum disease, smoking makes it harder for your gums to heal. Get help with giving up smoking.
* Keep your dentures clean – if you wear them, make sure you clean them regularly as a build-up of bacteria can lead to oral thrush.
