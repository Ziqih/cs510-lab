Panel (GAP): a group of lay reviewers affected by diabetes. Their role is to
reflect the collective perspective of people living with diabetes.

little scientific knowledge. As such, it's important that you think about your
lay reader and read our guidance on writing a good lay summary before
>>>>>>> GAP will **only** read the lay summary to make their assessment about
the research, so a well-communicated lay summary is essential. It is
worthwhile asking someone without a scientific background to read your lay

>>>>>>> ## Translating scientific summaries into lay language
>>>>>>> ### A good lay summary should include:
>>>>>>> * Context: Why are you doing the research? What is the
motivation behind the research application? Were the questions and outcome
measures informed by patients’ priorities, experience, and preferences?
>>>>>>> * Aims: State clearly the aims and objectives for a lay
>>>>>>> * Strategy: Describe clearly what you are actually going to
>>>>>>> * Impact: Explain how achieving the research objectives will
benefit people with diabetes and what the next proposed action will be if the

>>>>>>> * Details of how people with diabetes will be involved in
the study design, delivery and/or as research participants. How will they be
supported (e.g. will they be provided any training?) and what incentives will

>>>>>>> * Timescale to impact on the lives of people with diabetes,
>>>>>>> * Basic science applications must clearly demonstrate how
your research relates to diabetes and how it could provide valuable insights
for future research and/or translation into clinical practice.
>>>>>>> ### A good lay summary should avoid:
>>>>>>> * Detailed explanations of what diabetes is – lay readers
are likely to know a lot about this and will want to know more about the
>>>>>>> * Unnecessary jargon, abbreviations and technical terms
wherever possible. If you have to use them provide a clear explanation.

is usually obvious when this is done, and it is important to realise that the
lay summary is not the same as the scientific abstract.

>>>>>>> Previous research has identified that the largely unstudied protein
PPP1R1A, normally expressed at high levels in pancreatic beta cells, is lost
from many beta cells in Type 1 diabetes. We hypothesise that PPP1R1A is an
important regulator of the state of phosphorylation of Mda5, a sensor protein
>>>>>>> Our research has shown that a protein called PPP1R1A is usually found
in insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, but seems to disappear in
people with Type 1 diabetes. We believe that this protein plays an important
role in helping the body respond to virus infections.
>>>>>>> People of Black West African origin have 2-3 fold higher risk of Type
2 diabetes than White European origin, but respond less favourably to early
prevention and treatment. Detailed metabolic phenotyping will be carried out
in order to define the ethnicity-specific pathophysiology behind the
progression to Type 2 diabetes for men of Black West African and White
European origin. We know that ethnicity plays an important role in the risk of
developing Type 2 diabetes, and can also influence how well people respond to
treatments. We will study the metabolisms of Black West African and White
European men, to find out whether the biology behind why a person develops
>>>>>>> Adolescent patients with Type 1 diabetes are at increased risk of
renal and cardiovascular complications. We propose to conduct a randomised
controlled trial contrasting the effects of ACE inhibitor, statin or
combination therapy in 500 adolescents at high risk of renal complications.
The primary endpoint of a reduction in albumin secretion relating to each drug
will be measured.Young people with Type 1 diabetes can be at a higher risk of
diabetes-related complications, like kidney damage and heart disease. We are
testing whether two drugs – ACE inhibitor and statin – can prevent kidney
damage in 500 young people at risk of developing this complication. To see if
the drugs work, we’ll be looking at how much albumin (a protein that indicates
kidney damage) is in their urine. If the levels of albumin drop, it suggests
that the drug could prevent diabetes-related complications in young people.
