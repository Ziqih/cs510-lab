Good gut health, type 1 diabetes and islet autoimmunity are all found to be
linked according to an article by Finnish researchers published in the August
Professors Heli Siljander, Jarno Honkanen and Mikael Knip report that the
steep increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in the Western world after
World War II cannot be explained solely by genetic factors. They state that
this rise implies crucial interactions between predisposing genes and
“Three parallel phenomena in early childhood – the dynamic development of the
immune system, maturation of the gut microbiome, and the appearance of the
first T1D-associated autoantibodies – raise the question whether these
As an example of the rise in type 1, the researchers said in Finland the
incidence among children under the age of 15 years has increased from 12 to 65
Research areas summarised include intestinal bacterial microbiota, including
interactions between the genetic profile, nutrition, and susceptibility to
islet autoimmunity; intestinal virome and the relationship between virus and
type 1 diabetes; intestinal fungal community; microbiota in other sites; and
Based on their evaluations of those areas, the professors hypothesized that
intestinal microbiota may contribute to the development of type 1 via a two-
The first phase starts at birth and ends with the appearance of the first type
1-associated antibodies. During that phase, a successful training of the
developing immune system is required to establish self-tolerance and control
If during that phase the gut microbiome becomes unbalanced, the immune
system’s development becomes distorted and susceptibility to auto-immune
“The second phase … [transitioning] to overt T1D seems to be characterized by
a reduced microbial diversity and a proinflammatory intestinal dysbiosis. The
mechanisms behind the spreading of the relatively local intestinal
inflammation towards extra-intestinal autoimmunity remains to be explored in
“We are only at the beginning of learning about the role of the intestinal
microbiome in the development of T1D and other immune-mediated diseases.
Further efforts should be directed to studies on the role of the intestinal
mycrobiota and virome, their interplay, and their interaction with the host
