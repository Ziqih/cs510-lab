Constant monitoring of Blood Glucose Levels (BGLs) could soon be a thing of
the past as scientists develop a form of ‘smart’ insulin known as Ins-PBA-F.
The new compound, proven to be effective in mice, turns on when BGLs rise, and
off when they return to target levels. This could mean the number of insulin
injections needed may be reduced to only one a day or even just one a week,
and virtually all the daily mechanics associated with the condition, such as
Danny Chou, who led the research at the University of Utah, said people living
with diabetes wouldn’t have to worry about their BGLs as much. Currently the
concern is that too much insulin can drive BGLs so low it leads to
hypoglycaemia and potentially be fatal; alternatively, when BGLs are
consistently too high it can lead to serious long-term complications including
“In theory, there would be none of these glucose problems,” Mr Chou said.
Diabetes NSW & ACT Credentialled Diabetes Educator Vania Khoury said the smart
“So far, studies show the technology works in mice and provided human trials
are successful, the ‘smart’ insulin would make a profound improvement to
people’s lives. Marked improvements in BGLs can mean a sharp reduction in
short and long term diabetic complications leading to longer, healthier and
