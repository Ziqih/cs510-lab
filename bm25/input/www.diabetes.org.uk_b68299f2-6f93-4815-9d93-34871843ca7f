>>>>>>> # Research spotlight - stopping foot problems
>>>>>>> ### Having diabetes means you're at a much higher risk of getting foot
problems. Without the right treatment, people with diabetes can develop foot
ulcers, infections and, at worst, need to have amputations.
>>>>>>> That's why it's vital we find better ways to prevent and treat foot
complications, and our scientists are on the case.
>>>>>>> ## It all started in the 80's
>>>>>>> Our work with King’s College Hospital during the 1980s began to change
the footcare people with diabetes receive. From 1981, working with the
hospital, we helped set up the first Diabetic Foot Clinic in the UK. It
offered specialised and urgent care to people with diabetes who had foot
problems. After three years the number of major amputations had halved.
>>>>>>> “We’re indebted to Diabetes UK for the support we received. We were
able to establish a multidisciplinary team made up of podiatrists, nurses,
orthotists, surgeons and physicians and built the Diabetic Foot Clinic, which
included a specialist shoe-fitting service. And even today, the charity
continues to fund vital research to prevent foot complications.”
>>>>>>> Professor Michael Edmonds, founder of the King’s College Hospital foot
>>>>>>> Since then we’ve campaigned for similar improvements to footcare for
people with diabetes across the NHS. We’ve worked with hospitals and NHS
managers to make sure they have multidisciplinary footcare teams ready to stop
>>>>>>> ### Can new ceramic materials combat Charcot foot?
>>>>>>> Almost 90 years on, we’re still supporting research at the very same
foot clinic to improve footcare. Our funding there is helping Dr Nina Petrova
develop new treatments for a debilitating foot complication of diabetes,
called Charcot foot, which causes the bones in the foot to collapse.
>>>>>>> She's testing a new range of materials, called bioceramics, to see if
this can encourage healing and transform treatment for Charcot foot. Find out
>>>>>>> "Using bioceramics to treat fractures in people with Charcot foot will
have a huge impact, because this may lead to faster and complete healing of
fractures. Of course this may also lead to a significant reduction in foot
deformity, which in turn means less ulcers and hopefully less amputations.”
>>>>>>> ### Can chilli treat chronic foot pain?
>>>>>>> Professor Anand, at Imperial College London, is hoping to tackle
chronic pain in the feet caused by nerve damage. He'll test if a new skin
plaster that uses Capsaicin - the hot ingredient in chilli peppers - can help
treat foot pain and potentially reverse nerve damage in people with diabetes.
This could transform quality of life for people with this debilitating
complication. Find out more about Professor Anand's research into treatments
>>>>>>> ### Speeding up wound healing in foot ulcers
>>>>>>> Scientists know that levels of a particular protein (called PTP1B)
found in immune cells are higher in diabetic foot ulcers. Professor
Delibegovic, at the University of Aberdeen, is finding out if reducing the
activity of PTP1B can speed up the healing process in foot ulcers.
>>>>>>> This research could lead to the development of new treatments and
reduce the risk of devastating amputations in people with diabetes. Find out
more about Professor Delibegovic's research into foot ulcers.
