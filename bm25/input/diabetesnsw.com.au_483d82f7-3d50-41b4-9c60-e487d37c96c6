Are you living with type 2 diabetes? Has your GP hinted it might be time to
start insulin? Have you tried all oral medications available and yet your
blood glucose levels are still higher than your target range? Don’t bury your
head in the sand. Our program ‘Living with Insulin’ was made for people just
like you. It is also a great program for people already living with insulin
(with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes), that might benefit from refreshing
We all need insulin for our bodies to function properly. If you don’t have
enough insulin you will feel tired and be at risk of long-term complications.
Starting insulin will give you so much more energy and dramatically reduce
your risk of going to hospital with high blood glucose levels.
Read our testimonials from real people, renamed for privacy, who discovered
that they really can live better with insulin after attending the workshop.
Jim is a 67-year-old farmer living with type 2 diabetes who has lost a lot of
weight and is very active. He takes tablets but his blood glucose levels are
still rising and he has less energy these days. He was reluctant to start
injecting insulin but he now says: “After hearing I will have more energy and
understanding how simple injecting insulin will be, I feel ready. It was a
boost to hear from other people who also had fears about starting on insulin.”
Cheryl is a 50-year-old receptionist living with late onset type 1 diabetes.
She was initially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes due to her age at diagnosis.
“My blood glucose levels were going higher and higher regardless of the
dieting, exercise and medication,” she says. “It was very frustrating until I
went for a specialist appointment and was sent for further tests. Starting
insulin was a complete relief. Attending the living with insulin program was
of huge benefit to me. I have a greater understanding of diabetes. After
sharing the experience with other people, I don’t feel alone. I know what to
do and how to find help when I need it.”
Bob has used insulin for the past decade but came along to refresh his
“I really needed to learn all over again about using insulin,” he said. “It’s
like when you have had your driver’s licence for many years, bad habits creep
in and the road rules change over time. I realised after attending the course
that there was a lot I could improve on. It was great to share some of the
frustrations I feel out loud and to hear how other people cope with injecting
The small group in the Living with Insulin program allows people to share
experience and knowledge freely. While you will be guided to learn about
insulin and diabetes, your facilitator will use your knowledge and experience
