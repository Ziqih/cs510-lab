Worldwide, people are not eating enough fruit and vegetables. In Australia,
less than 4% of us meet the Australian Dietary Guideline recommendations for
vegetables by age group. Worryingly, children and teenagers are even less
likely than adults to be eating enough vegetables.
Less than 1% of kids aged two to three are eating the recommended 2.5 serves
of vegetables and legumes a day. Between ages four to eight, 0% of kids are
meeting their minimum 4.5 serves of vegetables per day. Most children up to 13
are eating two or fewer serves per day when the aim is closer to five serves.
Fruit intake is more positive, with almost four out of five (78%) two-to-three
year olds eating the recommended one serve. But this decreases as kids get
older, with 59% of four-to-eight year olds consuming the recommended 1.5
serves, and 39% of nine-to-13 year olds getting two serves, which is the
recommended minimum fruit intake for ages nine and above.
Children need to be familiarised with the taste of fruit and vegetables from a
young age to establish healthy habits later in life. Fruit is generally easier
as humans have an innate preference for sweetness. While some vegetables are
sweeter, they remain a struggle for many parents. But there are things mum and
dad can do to encourage youngsters to eat their veggies.
Fruits and vegetables all contain different vitamins and minerals meaning we
need to eat a variety when consuming our two serves of fruit and five serves
Using the rainbow is a great starting point for food choices as it encourages
variety. Even the Australian dietary guidelines refer to a rainbow.
Colour comes from different components in fruits and vegetables. For example,
components called anthocyanins contribute to the red through to purple colour
of fruits and vegetables such as plums, eggplant and red cabbage. Meanwhile,
beta carotene found in carrots create the yellow to orange colour.
The different colour associated components may also provide many health
benefits such as strengthening a child’s immune system and protecting their
Using colours that complement each other can make foods more appealing for
children. Different parts of fruit and vegetables including the skins, leaves
and flowers provide fun and interesting options too. This creates a teaching
experience where children can learn where a food comes from and which parts
Although some children may prefer to follow routines, repeating the same foods
for extended periods of time can become dull for both the child and the parent
and can cause deficiencies if followed in the long term.
To promote variety, children may enjoy creating colourful edible scenes such
as a fairy garden or a dinosaur jungle. Natural colours from fruit or
vegetable juices, such as blueberry juice, can even be used to change a food’s
These creative tasks are age dependent and may need to be demonstrated by a
parent. By school age children might enjoy trying these things independently
New ways of presenting foods, including different shapes, colours, containers
and serving utensils can encourage children to eat new foods. For example,
eating a meal with chopsticks that would otherwise require a knife and fork,
or being allowed to eat food with their hands, shows children a meal does not
This also offers an opportunity to showcase new foods from different cultures
not previously tried. Parents can encourage exposure to different cultures by
creating themed days where a cuisine is selected with the child, and food
Make food interactive; include your children in the planning, purchasing and
preparation of meals with age appropriate responsibilities. And don’t be
afraid of the likely mess that comes with children cooking. Embrace the
Preparing and eating meals together builds positive relationships, not only
with food but with each other. Turn off the TV during meal times and talk
This space also provides parents with a platform to role model desired food
behaviours to children. If you are a fussy eater, it’s likely your child will
Don’t get upset if children don’t want to try new foods the first few times –
you will need to be persistent. Make those challenging foods (such as
mushrooms or Brussels sprouts) available more frequently and in different
ways, such as by incorporating them into mixed dishes rather than serving them
on their own. Allow your child to see and touch unfamiliar fruits and
Often new foods will need to be presented to a child on between five and ten
occasions over time before they will try it. Importantly, if they taste it and
don’t like it, encourage their willingness to have tried something new.
Growing food with kids teaches them where food comes from. Marketing messages
strongly influence a child’s food preferences, and it’s important for children
to learn not all foods come from packages.
Space permitting, grow ingredients in a backyard garden or in pots on the
window sill so children can learn about the life cycle of food. Allow them to
experience planting a seed through to harvesting it to add to a meal.
If space is limited, teach children an awareness of the seasonal implications
of food and encourage eating fruit and vegetables that are in season. Start
with ones they know and like and progress towards new varieties.
