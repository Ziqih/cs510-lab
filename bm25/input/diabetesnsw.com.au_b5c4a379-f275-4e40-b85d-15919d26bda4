Seasonal food is fresher, tastier and more nutritious than food consumed out
of season. Even though we can eat strawberries year round, the best time to
eat them is shortly after harvest when they are full of flavour and, according
to some studies, contain more nutrients. Seasonal fruits and vegetables
produced on local farms are often fresher, as they do not require long
Below are some of the best spring fruits and veggies to get in your basket.
 **The goodness:** Leeks, like garlic and onions, belong to a vegetable family
called the allium vegetables. They contain flavonoids which help reduce
inflammation and have also shown to have cardiovascular protection. Plus they
contain lots of vitamins - A, C, K and B6.
 **How to choose:** Leeks should be firm and straight with dark green leaves
and white necks. Avoid those that are yellowed or wilted.
 **How to store:** Store leeks unwashed in a loose plastic bag in the fridge
where they will keep fresh for one to two weeks.
 **How to eat:** Try adding finely chopped leeks to salads or to broths and
 **The goodness:** Of all the commonly consumed cruciferous vegetables,
including cauliflower and cabbage, broccoli stands out as the most
concentrated source of antioxidant – vitamin C. They are also packed full of
vitamins E, K and B6, chromium, folate and are a good source of dietary fibre.
 **How to choose:** Pick broccoli that are firm, not bruised, with a uniformly
dark green, sage or purple-green colour. Avoid those that have yellow

 **How to eat:** Both raw and cooked broccoli can make excellent additions to
your meals. Use it raw in salads, toss it in pasta, or add it to omelettes.

vitamin C, they also contain anti-inflammatory nutrients that play a role in
protecting our cardiovascular system. They are jam packed with manganese,
 **How to choose:** When strawberries are optimally ripe, they not only have
the peak flavour and texture, but will have more nutrients. So choose berries
that are firm and plump, with a shiny, deep red colour.
 **How to store:** Strawberries are very perishable. Greater nutrient losses
can occur with storage of over two days. So to maintain their freshness, store

the maximum amount of nutrients, it’s best to enjoy them fresh and not
prepared in a cooked recipe. Strawberries are perfect as a snack or try adding
 **The goodness:** Pears are a great source of phytonutrients, which have
shown to provide us with antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory benefits.
Not only are they a good source of fibre, but also contain lots of vitamin C
 **How to choose:** Since pears are very perishable once they are ripe, look
for pears that are firm, but not too hard and free of bruises.
 **How to store:** If you are not eating ripened pears, they can be stored in
the fridge for a few days. If you would like to hasten the ripening process,
place them in a paper bag at room temperature.
 **How to eat:** Since the skin provides about half of the pears total fibre
as well as antioxidants, it is best to not peel the fruit when eaten. Sliced
pears are also a great addition to a walnut, fetta and rocket salad. Squeeze
several drops of lemon/lime to prevent the sliced pear from turning brown due
