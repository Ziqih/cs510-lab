Hussein has happily agreed to share his story of living with type 1 diabetes
and fleeing his home country, Syria, to build a new life in Australia.
Hussein was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 16 years ago. Until now, at the age
of 44, Hussein has struggled with this his blood glucose levels (BGLs).
In Syria, he did not have the same access to services and care he now has in
Australia and he found it difficult to manage his BGLs. There were long
waiting lists to see specialists and it was very costly. He lacked access to
medications, blood glucose meters and strips to help him manage his BGLs.
Once he arrived to Australia, he was linked in with his local diabetes clinic
at Mt Druitt Hospital, which he now attends regularly. He sees an
endocrinologist every two, four or six months depending on his BGLs. He is

with the Australian health system, and faced language and cultural barriers.
He found it difficult to locate some of the services and adjust to new
healthcare systems, which differed greatly from that in Syria.
In light of Refugee Week, Hussein would like to share some of his
recommendations regarding diabetes management. He emphasises the need for
prevention – making healthier food choices, and having an active lifestyle.
Hussein also stresses the importance of regular blood glucose monitoring
practices. He monitors his blood glucose levels regularly and, like many
others, feels frustrated when his results are not within the target ranges.
However, he does find regular monitoring helpful in understanding his
diabetes. He also recommends visiting a doctor every three to six months for
the routine ‘average blood glucose’ test (HbA1c), to assist further with
