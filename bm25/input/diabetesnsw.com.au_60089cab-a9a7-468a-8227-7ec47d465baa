A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is a small wearable device that measures
glucose levels throughout the day and night. It lets the user know what their
glucose level is at any time, and whether it is stable or on the way up or
down. It has alarms to let the user know if glucose levels are getting too low
These devices reduce the frequency of daily fingerprick blood glucose checks.
Some devices can work in conjunction with a compatible insulin pump while
others send information to a CGM receiver or and app on your smartphone.

The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is Australia’s first national
scheme for people with a disability, it provides reasonable and necessary
funding to people with a permanent and significant disability to access the
supports and services they need to live and enjoy their life. The NDIS is

 _Consumables_ are a support category available to assist participants with
purchasing everyday use items. Supports such as continence and home enteral
nutrition (HEN) products are included in this category. More information on
these supports can be found in the Assistive Technology and Consumables Code
Assistive technology is defined in the NDIS as “any device or system that
allows a participant to perform tasks that they would otherwise be unable to
do, or which increases the ease and safety with which tasks can be performed.”
Assistive technologies can also be referred to ‘aids’ or ‘equipment’.
In relation to assistive technology supports, the NDIA _must_ consider whether
the support is related to your disability and, before including any assistive
technology support in your plan, the NDIA must also be satisfied that the
support will assist you to pursue your goals, objectives and aspirations.
If you are looking at applying for CGM through the NDIS it is worthwhile
obtaining a letter from your specialist and/or CDE outlining why CGM would
benefit the management of your disability and how the diabetes is impacting on
your disability. The NDIS states: “Generally, a written report detailing
clinical reasoning and justification of recommended assistive technology is
required prior to approval of funding for complex, high risk or specialised

necessary expert assessment or assistance with selection, fitting, configuring
and training where these services are not otherwise available as part of the
purchase price or part of the standard service offering”. This could
theoretically include diabetes education, please check with your service
Please talk to your healthcare provider for more details.
