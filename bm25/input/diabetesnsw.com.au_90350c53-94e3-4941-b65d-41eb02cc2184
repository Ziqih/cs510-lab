# Study aims to reduce fractures in people with type 1
People living with diabetes face a significantly higher risk of osteoporotic
fractures than those without the condition. But the reason for this is not
Researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the US have started a
study will use novel measurement techniques to observe - at the atomic level -
the effect Type 1 diabetes has on bone and how medication could lessen the
Deepak Vashishth, Director of the Center for Biotechnology and
Interdisciplinary Studies who is leading the study said, "We're looking at the
mechanisms of what would cause such a fragility."
“This type of understanding is critical, because fractures cannot be fully
explained or anticipated using current clinical tools. Making this challenge
even more difficult is the fact that there appears to be a difference between
how Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes affect bone. People with Type 1 diabetes, he
said, face a greater lifetime risk of fracture than those with Type 2
The team will collect bone tissue samples from patients, over the age of 50,
who have Type 1 diabetes. They will also collect samples from patients without
They will then apply a novel protein-based approach, not currently used for
fracture diagnosis in clinics, to understand how Type 1 diabetes modifies bone
This innovative technique for measuring biochemical properties of bone tissue
aimed at determining how Type 1 diabetes modifies relationships between
organic and inorganic interfaces in bone at the atomic scale.
For example, the team will look at the accumulation of advanced glycation end-
products (AGEs), which are produced when sugar becomes available in the body
as it frequently does in people living with diabetes. AGEs are known to change
proteins within the bone, altering the cellular responses while also weakening
More specifically, Vashishth explained, “AGEs can alter the physical
arrangement of water molecules in bone proteins and bone crystals. His team
also wants to understand how such physical changes occur in Type 1 diabetes
and alter the mechanical strength of the bone.”
“These fundamental questions can only be answered through an interdisciplinary
approach that combines biology, physical chemistry, biochemistry, and
engineering the same type of collaboration that embodies the research done
Vashishth believes that a greater understanding of these biological and
mechanical alterations will help fuel the development of new diagnostic
modalities and prescription of medications that can counteract negative
changes, in turn protecting bone from the effects of diabetes.
“This research starts very much far away from the bedside and it ends up very
close to it. We are working on clinical examples here which will directly
affect the decision a clinician would make, hopefully as early as the next two
