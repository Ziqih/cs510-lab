Researchers from the University of Iowa may have discovered a safe new non-
By exposing mice with diabetes to a combination of static electric and
magnetic fields for a few hours per day, the team found it was able to
normalise two major hallmarks of type 2 diabetes.
"Exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) for relatively short periods
appears to reduce blood glucose and normalize the body's response to insulin.
The effects are also long-lasting, opening the possibility of an EMF therapy
being applied during sleep to manage diabetes all day." says Calvin Carter,
The unexpected and surprising discovery may have major implications in
diabetes care, particularly for people who find current treatment regimens
The study indicates that EMFs alter the balance of oxidants and antioxidants
in the liver, improving the body's response to insulin. This effect is
mediated by small reactive molecules that seem to function as "magnetic
The initial finding was pure serendipity and came after Sunny Huang, the
studies co-lead author, who has an interest in metabolism and diabetes, needed
to practice taking blood from mice and measuring blood glucose levels.
Carter let her borrow some of the mice he was using to study the effect of
"It was odd because the mice normally have high blood glucose and type 2
diabetes, but all of the animals exposed to EMFs showed normal blood glucose
The finding that these mice had normal blood glucose levels after EMF exposure
was doubly strange because the mice had a genetic modification which made them
“Early on, we recognized that if the findings held up, they could have a major
The findings held up in an extended study which found that the application of
static magnetic and electric fields modulated blood glucose in three different
The team also showed that exposure to such fields, approximately 100 times
that of the Earth's, during sleep, reversed insulin resistance within three
EMFs are everywhere; telecommunications, navigation, and mobile devices all
use them to function. EMFs are also used in medicine, in MRIs and EEGs, for
However, very little is known about how they affect biology. On their hunt for
clues to understand the mechanisms underlying the biological effects of EMFs
on blood glucose and insulin sensitivity, Carter and Huang reviewed literature
They found that many animals sense the Earth's electromagnetic field and use
it to orient themselves as well as for navigation.
"This literature pointed to a quantum biological phenomenon whereby EMFs may
interact with specific molecules. There are molecules in our bodies that are
thought to act like tiny magnetic antenna, enabling a biological response to
"Some of these molecules are oxidants, which are studied in redox biology, an
area of research that deals with the behaviour of electrons and reactive
The team collaborated with researchers from Brigham Young University who are
Their experiments suggest that EMFs alter the signaling of superoxide
molecules, specifically in the liver, which leads to the prolonged activation
of an antioxidant response to rebalance the body's redox set point and the
"When we remove superoxide molecules from the liver, we completely block the
effect of the EMFs on blood glucose and on the insulin response. The evidence
suggests that superoxide plays an important role in this process," Carter
In addition to the mouse studies, the researchers also treated human liver
cells with EMFs for six hours and showed that a surrogate marker for insulin
sensitivity improved significantly, suggesting that the EMFs may also produce
Carter and Huang are energized by the possibility of translating the findings
In terms of safety, the World Health Organization considers low energy EMFs
safe for human health. The UI study also found no evidence of any adverse side
The team is now working on a larger animal model to see if the EMFs produce
similar effects in an animal that has a more similar size and physiology to
humans. They also plan to conduct studies to understand the redox mechanism
Their ultimate goal is to move into clinical trials with patients to translate
the technology into a new class of therapies.
"Our dream is to create a new class of non-invasive medicines that remotely
take control of cells to fight disease," Carter says.
The findings of the research were first published in Cell Metabolism.
