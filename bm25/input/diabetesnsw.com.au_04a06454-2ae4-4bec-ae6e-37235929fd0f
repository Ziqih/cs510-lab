As more and more people find themselves in quarantine, self-isolation, or just
generally socially distancing themselves, maintaining physical activity may
become difficult over time. Now, more than ever, we need to do our best to
keep our physical activity levels high. However it’s just as, if not more,
important to practise good hygiene and stay safe. So that then begs the
question – can you go out to exercise? Is it safe for you to go for your
morning walk? Is it okay to take your dog for a walk?
Before we answer those questions, it’s important to understand why it is
important to maintain your physical activity. At the forefront, exercise is an
effective way to manage blood glucose levels. But beyond looking after your
diabetes, exercise is a great way to boost your mood, reduce boredom, and
provide a natural boost to your immune system. For these reasons, we need to
Exercising at home is the best way to maintain your physical activity levels
while making sure you’re staying safe. Use resistance bands or free weights if
you have any on hand, if not, using household objects is a great way to keep
your muscles active and your level of strength high. Do you have a set of
stairs at home? Try and climb them twice during the ad break of your favourite
show. Set a challenge, time yourself and beat your best time! Use a bag and
fill it with as many items as you can for some makeshift weights. Be as
creative as you like to keep your exercise varied and your motivation high.
Practising social distancing doesn’t mean you need to stay locked indoors.
However, if you are feeling unwell, or your usual walking route is very busy,
then perhaps reconsider your exercise, or choose a different area that will
keep your risk as low as possible. Yes it's fine to take the dog for a walk
but remember to keep your distance from others and practise good hygiene.
Outdoor exercise is a great way to maintain good mental health, with studies
suggesting that exercising outdoors has a boosted hormone response in
comparison to exercising indoors. This could serve as a great way to
simultaneously manage your mental health as well as your physical health.
## Can I still go to the gym?
Simply put, it’s not worth the risk. Gyms have been closed across the country
and for good reason – multiple people using the same equipment or people not
using towels or cleaning the equipment properly are all actions that may put
you at risk, that you have no control over. You might be better off performing
some body weight exercises at home or in the park; or if you have your own
personal equipment, then just make sure to keep it as clean as possible.
Exercise and Sports Science Australia have released a statement urging
Australian’s to maintain a healthy level of physical activity, and are working
closely with the Government in making sure that it’s safe for you to get your
exercise done. If you have any concerns about completing exercise in the
current circumstances, you’re not quite sure where to start, or if you have
any other questions, please feel free to give us a call on our Helpline (1300
342 238) to speak to one of our Accredited Exercise Physiologists.
