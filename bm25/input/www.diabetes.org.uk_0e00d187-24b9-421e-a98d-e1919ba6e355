## Eating 9-5, what a way to make a living...
Most of us have been there… sharing in the office cakes and treats, snacking
at our desks as we work, feeling the 4pm slump and reaching for a chocolate
bar, loading up on sugary coffees and caffeinated drinks to stay awake...
Sound familiar? Our modern working lives mean food can be a common feature in
If you often find yourself eating extra food at work, you are likely to notice
This feature will help you to recognise this behaviour happening, and help you
to make different choices if you choose to. If you’re not working, there may
also be some information of value, as statistics show that a large proportion
of unemployed and retired individuals in the UK are also likely to have a
Rewind the clock 20+ years ago and workplaces just didn’t have the same array
of enticing snacks and treats – the explosion of delicious snack foods and the
culture of ‘food as a treat’ has really infiltrated our modern workplaces.
Even when we’re trying to make healthy choices, co-workers can put the
pressure on to ‘join in’ with their eating - ‘go on, one won’t hurt you!’ -
and there can even be a subtle feeling of rejection in the air if we hold our
Many of us get a sense of connection and bonding when we eat with others, so
Stress can also be a big influencer; feeling in control of our lives is an
important part of being human, and as funny as it sounds, if we’re working on
a complex work problem that we can’t master, the feeling of being able to
master the muffin, burger or fizzy drink can help us feel more in control of
And, of course, in all the tasks that might be overwhelming us, food is also a
small piece of much-needed ‘me-time’, and can provide some relief from boredom
if we are involved in dull or monotonous tasks.
Work can be engrossing - in ways both good and bad - and some people can get
lost in a task and forget to eat.
This may mean that when they do, they’re more likely to be ravenous and grab
whatever is close to hand to solve the hunger problem.
From a practical perspective, with all that has to be accomplished in the
working day, we might feel as if we haven’t the time to prioritise the
preparation of healthy snacks and lunches, or are too busy to go out to buy
It’s not only the case for those with a 9-5 desk job. Similar habits can
develop as a result of working long hours, operating on night shifts, being
constantly on your feet, or travelling for business.
Changes to routine can easily lead to forgetting to regularly test blood
glucose and the timing of taking diabetes medication can also be affected.
So, how can you begin to take some positive steps if you’re inspired to make a
* Put a reminder on the hand or wrist of your dominant hand (this is the one you write with, and the one you are most likely to use to reach for food), so you’re reminded to ask yourself, ‘Am I hungry for food, or something else?’
* You may want to talk to your colleagues about how food ‘shows up’ in the workplace. Could you ask a friend to remind you to pause and think about whether the sweet treat is what you want?
* Could you come up with some creative ways to have a break or a treat in the workplace, that doesn’t involve eating? Imaginative ideas I’ve heard include telling each other jokes, finding ‘teach yourself to dance’ video clips and spending 5 minutes learning a new move together and giving each other a 1 minute shoulder rub or hand massage. Pin a list up in the kitchen and see how inventive you can get.

* Experiment with a rule to eat fruit first (or any healthier choice) and then, if you’re still hungry, go aheadand eat.
* Remember the more general lifestyle advice, such as taking the stairs instead of using the lift, and walking instead of driving to appointments when you can.
Could you try just one of these strategies in the week to come? If you work
full time, it’s likely you spend the majority of your waking week at work. So,
if you can, it’s worth investing some time in making your job work for you and
Thanks to anti-discrimination employment practices, diabetes shouldn’t be
holding anyone back in the workplace, so do whatever you can to feel in
control of the food environment at work, too.
Always try and give yourself the best chance to manage your diabetes, whether
