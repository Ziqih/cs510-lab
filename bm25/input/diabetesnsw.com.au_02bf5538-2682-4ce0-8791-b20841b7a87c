Eid ul-Fitr, the ‘Festival of Breaking the Fast’, is a three-day celebration
marking the end of Ramadan and welcoming the month of Shawwal. It is a joyous
occasion, starting with special Islamic prayers often performed in
congregation in a large open field. Social gatherings are an integral part of
this auspicious occasion but this year Eid will have a different ambience with

There is certainly nothing wrong with enjoying small portions of these fancy
delights, but overindulgence can give your body a tremendous shock after a
month of fasting. Consuming a lot of energy dense foods can lead to
indigestion, stomach upset, bloating, weight gain and high blood glucose
## Here are some simple tips to make sure your Eid-ul Fitr is a healthy one!
After a month of devotion and restraint it is easy to go overboard with the
delicious treats. Eating slowly, focusing on the feel, taste and sensation of
chewing each mouthful will help set you for the day.
Prior to serving, set guidelines for yourself about what and how much you will
eat. This will help prevent overeating. Try not to pile food on your plate as

have small frequent meals. Each meal should be packed with veggies.
Check your blood glucose levels more regularly. Changes in routine and eating
habits and adjustments to your medication after Ramadan can have an unexpected

for advice about management of blood glucose levels if they remain high.
A good walk around the block can positively affect your mood and help in
managing your appetite. Exercise releases feel good hormones which can make
you feel revitalized and keep your diabetes in check. Exercise improves
glucose uptake by the muscles and the body’s insulin sensitivity, so that
insulin has a greater effect in reducing BGLs both during and after exercise.
Drinking water is important to prevent dehydration after extended periods of
fasting. It is especially important after eating sweets as the kidneys will
use water to flush sugar out of the system. Try to drink one cup of water
