A Stanford research team believe they have found a way to boost the
effectiveness of the insulin to help with blood glucose control.
The team, led by scientist Eric Appel, have developed a way to combine insulin
with a second hormone known as amylin, to create a two-in-one shot or
injection that could, if proven safe in human trials, make it easier for
people living with diabetes to control their blood glucose levels.
Amylin plays a synergistic role with insulin to control blood glucose levels
after eating in a way that is more effective than insulin alone and mimics
While the amylin-based drug is already commercially available, it is estimated
that less than 1 percent of people living with diabetes taking insulin therapy
also take this complementary treatment because the two hormones – which work
together seamlessly in the body – are too unstable to coexist in the same
“Taking that second injection with the insulin shot is a real barrier for most
patients. Our formulation would allow them to be given together in a single
injection or in an insulin pump,” said Appel.
The new technique involves a protective coating that wraps around insulin and
amylin molecules and, for the first time, allows them to coexist in a single
“This coating dissolves in the bloodstream, enabling these two important
hormones to work together in a way that mimics how they function in healthy
So far, the researchers have tested the wrapper’s stability in the laboratory,
and done preliminary experiments to see how their two-in-one injection works
on the most advanced preclinical model – diabetic pigs. But, because both
drugs are already on the market and the dual-drug formulation was tested in
advanced models, Appel said the team need only demonstrate that their
technique is nontoxic in humans to start trials in people, bringing this
technology closer to market than most early-stage drugs.
Appel and his collaborators hope this approach could, one day, dramatically
increase the use of amylin and lead to improved glucose management for the
estimated 450 million people worldwide with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
“Although few people living with diabetes currently take the amylin-based drug
after their insulin injection, those who do experience profound benefits,”
Past clinical data shows that patients taking both lose weight and have better
control over their blood glucose. Enhanced diabetes management can reduce the
risk of serious health complications, such as kidney failure, blindness, heart
disease and amputations, all of which loom over anyone with diabetes.
If the wrapper approach makes it possible to combine insulin and amylin in one
dose, this would offer people living with diabetes a convenient way to mimic
their natural secretion in the human body. For people without diabetes, amylin
is secreted from the same cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. Insulin
improves the uptake of sugar by cells, removing it from the bloodstream. For
its part, amylin does three things to control blood glucose. First, it stops
another hormone, glucagon, from telling the body to release additional glucose
that has been stored in the liver. Second, it produces a sense of “fullness”
at mealtimes that reduces food intake. Third, it actually slows the uptake of
food by the body, reducing the typical spike in blood glucose after a meal.
All three are a boon to diabetes care.
In animal studies, the researchers saw significant overlap of the activity of
the dual-drug formulation, an important finding that indicates the approach is
closely mimicking what happens in a healthy body – including a near-total
suppression of glucagon, the hormone that tells the liver to release stored
glucose, even though the person has just consumed a meal.
“We’re excited about the results to say the least,” Appel said. The team has
already filed for a patent on the technology.
The study was published May 11 in Nature Biomedical Engineering.
