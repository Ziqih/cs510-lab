The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently released the 2019 Global Health
Estimates which identifies the 10 leading causes of death and disability.
The data covers the period from 2000 – 2019.
The estimates highlight the need for a focus on preventing and treating
cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases and
injuries in in all regions of the world.
##**Heart disease number 1; diabetes in the top 10**
Heart disease has remained the leading cause of death, globally, for the last
20 years. It is now killing more people than ever before.
The number of deaths from heart disease increased by more than 2 million since
2000, to nearly 9 million in 2019. Heart disease now represents 16% of total
deaths from all causes. More than half of the 2 million additional deaths were
Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia are now among the top 10
causes of death worldwide, ranking 3rd in both the Americas and Europe in
2019. Women are disproportionately affected: globally, 65% of deaths from
Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia are women.
###**Men more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes**
Deaths from diabetes increased by 70% globally between 2000 and 2019. Men were
disproportionately affected with an 80% rise in deaths from diabetes among
In the Eastern Mediterranean, deaths from diabetes have more than doubled and
represent the greatest percentage increase of all WHO regions.
Globally there has been an overall decline in deaths from communicable
Pneumonia and other lower respiratory infections were the deadliest group of
The overall declines in communicable disease reflects the success of efforts
to prevent disease through large scale testing and treatment. For example,
HIV/AIDS dropped from the 8th leading cause of death in 2000 to the 19th in
2019 due to efforts to prevent infection, test and treat the virus over the
This same pattern was seen was malaria and tuberculosis.
##**People living longer – but with more disability**
The WHO estimates also confirm the growing trend for longevity.
In 2019, people were living more than six years longer than in 2000, with a
global average of more than 73 years in 2019 compared to nearly 67 in 2000.
But on average, only five of those additional years were lived in good health.
To a large extent, the diseases and health conditions that are causing the
most deaths are those that are responsible for the greatest number of healthy
Complications from diabetes, heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease were collectively responsible for nearly 100
million additional healthy life-years lost in 2019 compared to 2000.
Injuries are another major cause of disability and death. There has been
significant increases in road traffic injuries affecting males across the
In the Americas, drug use has emerged as a significant contributor to both
disability and death. There was a nearly threefold increase in deaths from
drug use disorders in the Americas between 2000 and 2019.
This region is also the only one for which drug use disorder is a top 10
contributor to healthy life-years lost due to premature deaths and disability,
while in all other regions, drug use does not make the top 25.
WHO’s Global Health Estimates present comprehensive, comparable and
transparent time-series data for population health, including life expectancy,
healthy life expectancy, mortality and morbidity, and burden of disease at
global, regional and country levels disaggregated by age, sex and cause, from
“These estimates are produced using data from the best available sources from
countries and the international community,” said Dr Bochen Cao, the technical
“They are based on robust scientific methods for the processing, synthesis and
analysis of data. These updated estimates also benefited from the valuable
contributions of WHO’s Member States through active country consultation and
The availability of services to prevent, diagnose and treat disease is key to
reducing death and disability, influencing where different conditions are
ranked. These new estimates clearly indicate where additional investments in
“Robust health data are critical to address inequalities, prioritize policies
and allocate resources to prevent disability and save lives,” adds Dr Samira
Asma, Assistant Director-General for the Division of Data, Analytics and
“The WHO Global Health Estimates are a powerful tool to maximize health and
economic impact. We call upon governments and stakeholders to urgently invest
in data and health information systems to support timely and effective
At the time the report was published COVID-19 has tragically claimed more than
1.5 million lives. People living with pre-existing health conditions (such as
heart disease, diabetes and respiratory conditions) are at higher risk of
Health authorities worldwide depend on timely, reliable and actionable data to
make informed decisions – this is especially true during a global pandemic.
The next update to these estimates will include an assessment of the direct
and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality and morbidity.
