symptoms and her plans for keeping busy during isolation.
>>>>>>> I was born five weeks early, hence my name Khadija, which means early
baby girl! My pancreas was overproducing insulin, which meant I was having a
lot of hypos, and so the doctors made the decision to remove my pancreas when
>>>>>>> I was monitored by a diabetes team and had to check my blood glucose
levels daily, before starting on insulin injections when I was nine. I’ve
found managing my diabetes challenging at times but in 2017 I went onto the
Freestyle Libre (flash glucose monitor), which made a huge difference to my
>>>>>>> About three weeks ago I came home from work with what I would describe
as flu-like symptoms. Within the first two days I had a really high
temperature and then developed shortness of breath and a cough. Initially I
wasn’t going to call 111 as I thought I would just get over it, but after
seeing the NHS guidelines I thought it was sensible to get myself checked.
>>>>>>> After calling 111, paramedics were sent to my house and did my general
observations. They didn’t think I needed to be admitted to hospital but told
me to ring 111 again and arrange to be tested for Covid-19. However, when I
tried to do this the following day I was told that because I hadn’t been in
contact with anyone who had visited an at-risk area, I should just self-
isolate and see how I got on. When my symptoms weren’t improving, I contacted
111 again but was advised to isolate for a further seven days, as they were
still unable to test me. It did feel like I was being left to look after
>>>>>>>> Thankfully this past week I’ve been feeling much better and I’m not
as short of breath. My symptoms have definitely been in line with those of
Covid-19 but I suppose I’ll never know for definite if I’ve had the virus!

>>>>>>> Initially my mum didn’t develop symptoms but still needed to isolate
with me, especially given that she’s a nurse. Luckily she was able to return
to work, which was great, as I know it’s a difficult time at the moment with
many NHS staff self-isolating and hospitals being so busy.
>>>>>>> She developed a routine where she would get in from work and change at
the door, then have a bath. She was just being extra cautious to protect me.
She was also having to do all the shopping, as I’m not going out.
>>>>>>> However, mum's now developed symptoms herself and is isolating in her
room, so there’s been a bit of a role reversal with me cooking meals and
checking up on her – from a safe distance.
>>>>>>> * Staying at home and managing diabetes
>>>>>>> Now that I’m feeling better I’ve got lots to keep me busy, so I’m
managing quite well with the lockdown. I’m set up to work from home and thanks
to Microsoft Teams and Zoom, I’ve been able to chat and video call people from

submit the week I became unwell. The university have given me an extension, so
I’m just working on the final edits. I was supposed to be handing it in and
