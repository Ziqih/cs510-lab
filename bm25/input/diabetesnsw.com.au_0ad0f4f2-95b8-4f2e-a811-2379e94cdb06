# Is height a risk for type 2 diabetes?
Does your height impact your likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes?
According to a study published in the journal Diabetologia shorter people are
Tall people might be at greater risk of developing cancer, but short people
have their own risks, according to the research.
Researchers looked at more than 2,500 middle-aged men and women in Germany
from a pool of about 26,000 people. After adjusting for age, lifestyle,
education and waist circumference, researchers found that greater height was
The team evaluated height by taking into account both sitting height and leg
length. The heights ranged from under 169.7cm (5’6”) to above 180.3cm (5’11”)
for men and under 157.8cm (5’2”) to above 168.1cm (5’6”) for women.
It found that, for both men and women, the risk of diabetes was lower by more
than 30 per cent for each 10cm difference in height.
Part of the association between greater height and a lower risk for diabetes
may come from the associations between greater height and lower liver fat
content and other diabetes risk factors, like blood lipids, said Matthias
The study also argues that shorter people should be monitored for diabetes and
risk factors related to cardiovascular disease. Because liver fat contributes
so much to the higher risk in shorter individuals, reducing liver fat may
provide a way to reduce the risk of diabetes.
Gail Melkus, associate dean for research in NYU's Rory Meyers College of
Nursing and a diabetes researcher, called the study "a piece of the pie" in
researching diabetes. Professor Melkus is unaffiliated with the study.
"I think that the conclusions have to be cautiously interpreted because it's a
secondary data analysis, meaning they didn't get a group of people and follow
She said the study poses an interesting question: Should short stature be
another risk factor for screening for type 2 diabetes, along with family
history or obesity? More research needs to be done to determine the answer.
Still, she said short people shouldn't automatically think they're destined
for diabetes, nor should tall people think they're safe and sound, especially
"It's not just one risk factor that we need to consider when screening people
