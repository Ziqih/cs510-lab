>>>>>>>> Accessibility should be everyone’s responsibility and I strongly feel
that when it comes to making our world more accessible for all, doing nothing
>>>>>>> Chris, a disability awareness trainer and accessibility consultant,
lost all useful vision at the age of 8 due to a combination of an extremely
rare medical condition and a seemingly routine case of conjunctivitis. He
contacted us to tell us what kind of things we could do to make our website
>>>>>>> Chris Cook shares experiences aboutDiabetes UK and
>>>>>>> Working for the railways, I know that people are very quick to
complain when things go wrong. If you don’t complain constructively though,
>>>>>>> My blindness is the most visible of my medical conditions, but is
ironically the one which poses the least threat to my life in a medical
>>>>>>>> I recently tried to watch a film on the Diabetes UK website about
hypos that didn't have audio description. I couldn’t get anything from it and
it made me worry that other things may have been overlooked.
>>>>>>> I got in touch with the charity to tell them that in this instance,
they’d got it very wrong. They listened to what I had to say and now I’m
delighted to have started volunteering with the online team to ensure that the
website is much more accessible for people with sight loss.
>>>>>>> Totally blind people like me use a screen reader, which is a piece of
software installed on a PC, tablet or smartphone, which reads out what's on
the screen. I'm unable to use a mouse and therefore rely totally on being able
to use the keyboard, to navigate around web pages, emails or Word or similar
>>>>>>> I’m a member of Diabetes UK. Instead of the printed members’ magazine
Balance, I get an audio version on CD which means I can listen to it at my
leisure. In the future, I'd love to be able to get a podcast version of it, as
this would allow me to browse through the magazine's contents much faster and
>>>>>>> I’m happy to speak up on behalf of others, who may lack the confidence
to do it themselves. Accessibility should be everyone’s responsibility and I
strongly feel that when it comes to making our world more accessible for all,
doing nothing is not an option. If there is one phrase or saying, which neatly
sums up my attitude to life, it would be: "Always choose courage over
>>>>>>> It’s important that visually impaired people can access content on a
>>>>>>> It wasn't until the end of the first year of my postgraduate research
degree in accessible public transport, that I was first diagnosed with type 2
diabetes. There’s no history of it in my family and it’s not related to my
>>>>>>> At first the diagnosis seemed like yet another condition to have to
come to terms with and when I was unable to control it with diet alone, I had
to begin a regime of Metformin and Gliclazide tablets and subsequently a daily
Liraglutide (Victoza) injection. I quickly realised that another course of
major adjustment in my life had arrived, when I was least expecting it.
>>>>>>> I was born with a condition called "Riley-Day Syndrome" or to give it
its full title "Familial Dysautonomia". I fortunately only have some parts of
this condition, which mainly affects my body's sensitivity to pain and
temperature. This means that I need to be particularly careful when bathing,
showering or cooking that I don't accidently scald myself and not realise it
>>>>>>> After having suffered a routine bout of conjunctivitis as a baby,
which deteriorated into a serious eye infection, which resulted in both my
corneas being damaged, the decision was taken to perform corneal grafts on
both eyes, in order to attempt to restore my sight.
>>>>>>> Unfortunately, another trait of Riley Day Syndrome presented itself
following the surgery, which is that my body creates excess scar tissue round
wounds and so the grafts were never able to take fully. The first eight years
of my life were mainly spent either in hospital having more corneal grafts
performed or being schooled at home by a mixture of my parents and various
>>>>>>>> I'd be lying if I said that these early years of my life weren't
traumatic, but I had the resilience which many children are blessed with, to
be able to adapt to major changes in their lives together with the unwavering
>>>>>>> I also had my love of railways and trains, which has been with me
since birth and which will be with me for the rest of my life.
>>>>>>> I had to learn new, safe ways of finding my way around, learning
braille so that I could read once again and learning to touch type, so that
I'd still be able to communicate with the outside sighted world, which I'd
>>>>>>>> All these skills still stand me in great stead today, especially the
ability to touch type. In those days, I was using either a manual or an
electric typewriter, whereas today I'm typing this article on a PC. The
ability to communicate by whatever means is nevertheless an absolutely
>>>>>>> At the age of 11, I began attending a boarding school for the blind in
Worcester, which still exists today. In the eight years I spent there, we were
taught to live independent lives, to navigate safely round the town centre, do
our own shopping, cooking and washing and to travel safely on public transport
>>>>>>> I did my GCSEs and A-levels and Worcester and then went on to read
modern languages at the University of Wales, Swansea, before deciding to
specialise in public transport and complete my postgraduate research degree in
>>>>>>> I was naturally worried about injecting myself being totally blind and
with the reduced sensitivity caused by my Riley Day Syndrome. How could I
maintain my independence and not injure myself by pushing the needle in too
far? These and many other concerns were swirling round my mind, when I arrived
>>>>>>> I'd like to pay great tribute to an extremely experienced and
dedicated diabetes specialist nurse Zoe, who calmly and methodically began
talking through all my concerns and teaching me how to use the pre-filled pen
>>>>>>>> Zoe had had plenty of previous experience of teaching people with
very little or no sight how to use such pens and this proved to be invaluable.
Healthcare professionals who aren’t used to dealing with visual impairment may
have taken the attitude that I might need to have someone help me inject
myself on a daily basis, but you always want to live as independently as
>>>>>>> Zoe’s been outstanding. She taught me how many clicks of the dial I
needed to count round, to dial up the correct dose and the process of
unpacking, fitting, using and disposing of the needles.
>>>>>>> We both decided that auto-cover needles were the best sort for me to
use, as there was no danger of me accidentally pricking my fingers whilst
fitting the new needle and thereby potentially contaminating it, or when
>>>>>>> Zoe's calmness and ever positive attitude really shone through and I
quickly became familiar with the safe operation of the equipment and have been
able to inject totally independently from the very beginning with only the odd
>>>>>>> When I had to switch to a new Semaglutide pen, the needles I’d come to
rely on weren’t listed as fitting that pen. But Zoe said: 'there’s no reason
why the needles you know and love won't fit the new pen" and she turned out to
be quite right!. I then encouraged her to spread the word via the drug company
reps and other channels, in case there were others like me out there using
these auto-cover needles, who needed to switch to the same type of pen.
>>>>>>> Living with total blindness can be challenging at the best of times;
coping with type 2 diabetes on top of that can be doubly so.
>>>>>>> I've always been totally fascinated by trains and all things related
to railways. I've been lucky enough to have worked in many different areas of
the public transport field, but almost all of them have involved trains of one
>>>>>>> I help train many of the station staff and train crew in disability
awareness including how to guide visually impaired people safely through
stations and onto and off trains and help them find a seat on board. I also
remind them to look out for bracelets like my Medic Alert one, which contain
medical information useful in an emergency. I also use my experiences of
diabetes in my training too. I make staff aware that someone behaving
erratically may be suffering from a hypo, for example rather than simply being
under the influence of alcohol. Another thing I stress to my colleagues is
that when a situation becomes safety critical, doing nothing is not an option.
>>>>>>> I’ve missed social interaction as I’m normally out and about on the
trains and stations doing training. We’re a very close-knit family on the
railway network. I’ve been keeping in touch with my colleagues via email and
zoom though and look forward to being back out there with them on the network
>>>>>>> I’ve not been the kind to run marathons or climb mountains. I’ve
always been fascinated by travel and how people get around. Lockdown has been
extremely challenging for me, but I'm sure it has for many others too. I go
for nice walks with my pet old English sheepdog Dobby, who's named after the
>>>>>>> I have an excellent GP and diabetes centre and I’m seen every quarter
>>>>>>> Cooking isn’t something I do much of despite my surname, but I do try
and eat well. I've grown to love bran flakes for a really healthy breakfast,
to start the day off right. I love a nice hot, spicy curry and that’s been my
>>>>>>> But with the excellent help and support of healthcare professionals
like Zoe, of charities like Diabetes UK and Medic Alert and above all the love
and support of friends, family and work colleagues, it is indeed possible to
