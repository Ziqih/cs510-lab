### There’s no reason that a child with Type 1 diabetes shouldn’t be able to
go on a school trip or miss out on any part of school life.
School across the UK have a legal responsibility to make arrangements to
support any student with a medical condition so that they can enjoy the same
opportunities as any other child, including school trips.
Before a school trip, have a meeting with the parents, child and their PDSN to
cover what their needs are outside of school time.
Any child with diabetes should already have an individual healthcare plan or
IHP which goes shows what they need and which members of staff help them.
This meeting should ideally take place about six weeks before the trip,
although the sooner you can meet the better. This is so you have enough time
to train any members of staff on any area’s that might come up in the meeting.
If possible, it’s a good idea if the members of staff that help to look after
a student’s diabetes in school can go on the school trip. This is because the
child and their parents will already be comfortable and confident with them
At least two people should be fully trained to support a child with diabetes,
but all members of staff who are going on the trip should be aware of the
child’s diabetes and what to do in case of an emergency.
There should always be enough trained staff available to support and make sure
students with diabetes can take part. Schools should never rely on parents or
If you’re taking students on a school trip where you’re staying overnight, a
child with diabetes will need insulin injections and their blood sugar

If your student uses a pump, you might need a pump set change depending on how
If the child can’t blood test or do their own injections or manage their pump,
this will need to be done by a member of staff. The staff who will do this
should meet with the parents and PDSN well in advance of the trip to talk
about what help their child will need and get extra training if needed.
School staff who organise school trips should be aware of how a child’s
diabetes might impact on their participation, but there should be enough
flexibility to ensure a child can still join in.
School staff should look at what reasonable adjustments they might need to
make so a child with diabetes can take part and have fun safely.
It is best practice to carry out a risk assessment to identify any changes
that need to be made to a child’s care that you don’t look after on a normal
school day. This will need to be done in good time and with the child, if
The main risk for a child with diabetes is that they become unwell because of
high or low blood sugar levels. If not managed properly, this can lead to the
Activity, food, any change in routine, stress and excitement can all affect
blood sugar levels, all of which are likely to happen on a school trip. But if
school staff are aware of these potential risks, action can be taken to make
sure a child is safe and that their diabetes is managed.
