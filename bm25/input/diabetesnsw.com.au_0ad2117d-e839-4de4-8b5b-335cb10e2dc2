Australia’s Healthy Weight Week is a great time to start thinking about making
healthy changes in your lifestyle and diet. They don't need to be drastic to
have benefits. In fact, changes that are easier to stick to in the long term
can be some of the best you will ever make!
One way you can achieve a healthier weight and an all-around healthier
lifestyle is by cooking. Eating more home cooked meals means you tend to eat
smaller portions and ultimately consume less kilojoules, fat, sugar and salt.

* A **‘Grow’** option – Lean protein options help provide the building blocks for growth and repair. Some healthier options include oily fish like tuna or salmon, eggs, skinless chicken, lean meat, tofu and nuts and

when it comes cooking healthier meals. Sauces are often high in salt even if
they do not taste salty. Too much salt has been linked to higher blood
pressure and an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Other flavouring
ideas that are better options and yet still just as simple include garlic,
lemon or lime juice, vinegar and herbs and spices. The trick is knowing what
herb and spice combo works best. Here are some ideas depending on your dish.

How you cook your meal matters. Lower fat cooking methods such as steaming,
stir-frying and baking can help reduce extra kilojoules and help support a
healthier weight. Healthy fat is still essential but like anything ensure you
don’t overdo it and choose healthier varieties like avocado, olive oil and
nuts. Aim to include a thumb size portion with your meal. Don’t forget to
limit cooking methods that involve saturated fat or excess amounts of oil for
example deep frying or using butter, cream and cheesy sauces.
