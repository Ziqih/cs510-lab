The word protein often conjures up images of bodybuilders, muscles, pieces of
steak, fit athletes and perhaps a powdered shake. Out of all of the
macronutrients, protein really is the one that still has a pretty squeaky
clean image. Poor old fat and carbohydrate continually are under scrutiny,
while good old protein stands out as the child that can do no wrong. So is
this reputation deserved, and for people living with diabetes is there
anything else you need to know about protein?
There is no denying it, foods that are good sources of protein in our diet
have many benefits and are essential to life. Protein is a macronutrient that
is made up of amino acids, the building blocks that help create and repair
muscles, tissues, bones, hormones and enzymes in our body.
When thinking about food and diabetes management on a day to day basis, the
main goal is usually trying to choose foods that don’t cause blood glucose
levels (BGLs) to soar and then later crash. When eaten, protein alone causes
little rise of glucose in the blood initially. This gets people excited and
why you often hear advice around aiming to choose meals and snacks high in
Research is starting to show that both fat and protein can cause BGLs to rise
in a delayed manner (three to five hours after a meal); however, this is only
of major significance for particular meals that are large in portion size or
that also contain large volumes of fat and protein. These factors are of more
consideration to you if you are living with type 1 diabetes.
Another benefit of including high quality protein foods in your diet, is that
it plays a role in appetite regulation and can give you a sense of satisfying
fullness after you’ve eaten. Feeling full means you are less likely to want to
reach for further food or snacks again after meals, helping to ensure BGLs
Media and advertising may lead you to believe we don’t get enough protein in
our diets and that needing to supplement is the only answer. This is false for
the majority of people. The reality is, these additional protein supplements
usually add on extra kilojoules, leading to unnecessary weight gain and wasted
Protein supplements are best for elite athletes, for people who are unwell, or
for elderly patients that find it difficult to eat enough food.
The fact is, too much of one thing is not always healthy for us in life. All
macronutrients have their specific roles to keep us functioning well, so
aiming to keep your diet balanced ensures less chance of nutritional
deficiencies and the knock on effects that this may cause.
Eating too much protein in extreme circumstances can even be harmful, as it
puts both the liver and kidneys under more pressure. This can also have a
negative effect on bone health, as too much protein may cause excessive losses
The key is to ensure you choose high quality proteins from real foods.
## **Sources of high quality protein rich foods**
Protein come from both animal and plant sources. Some will be foods made up
predominantly of just protein, while other foods may also contain
Protein foods containing carbohydrates will directly impact BGLs if the amount
of carbohydrate is large enough. This does not make these foods unhealthy for
people living with diabetes, but just means you need to be mindful of portion
Here is a list of some healthy protein rich foods that you may like to
consider incorporating into your diet at both meal and snack times.
##**Protein rich foods with little carbs** - should not impact your BGLs
Steak grilled (85g) = 27g protein| Chicken breast grilled (85g) = 25g protein|
 | Handful of nuts = 6g protein| 2 x cheese sandwich slices = 10g protein
##**Protein rich foods containing carbs** – will impact your BGLs (depending
 | 150g tub yoghurt = 7g protein| 1 cup mixed beans = 13g protein
Importantly, the amount of protein needed in your diet differs from person to
person. Like most things diet related, you will need individualised advice.
Your age, gender, exercise levels, other health conditions and if you are
pregnant are just some of the factors to be taken into account.
Here is a general guide of how much protein to be aiming for each day:
 **19-70 years**|64g per day| 46g per day
 **70+ years**|81g per day| 57g per day
