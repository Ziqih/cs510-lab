Women with type 1 diabetes are more likely to suffer serious health problems
than men, according to a study undertaken by the University of Queensland’s
The research analysed 26 diabetes studies dating back to 1965, covering more
than 200,000 people. The researchers found that women with type 1 diabetes had
a 40% increased risk of death from any cause and more than twice the risk of
dying from heart disease compared to men with type 1 diabetes.
Study leader Professor Rachel Huxley said the marked difference between the
genders could change how women with type 1 diabetes were treated and managed.
“It is speculated that women with type 1 diabetes tend to have greater
difficulties with insulin management and glycaemic control than men – factors
that could contribute to their increased risk of heart disease,” Professor
Huxley said. “However, more research is needed to determine why the disease
poses a greater risk to women than men.”
Professor Huxley said the study also found that women with type 1 diabetes
were at greater risk of strokes and 44% more likely to die from kidney disease
than men. Interestingly, however, type 1 diabetes was not linked to an
increased risk of death from cancers in either gender.
Despite the evidence discovering a higher risk of comorbidities for women,
Sarah Hedgecock, writing on Forbes.com, says the actual figures for deaths
from diabetes is higher in men than women – but that can be partly explained
by the fact more men have type 1 diabetes than women.
Sue Leahy, Credentialed Diabetes Educator at Diabetes NSW & ACT, cautioned
“The study is certainly interesting and raises some valid questions about
women’s health, however it is important to note that the study may not take
“It also covers a wide range of studies across a long period of time, that
would have had different parameters and varying controls in place,” she added.
“Things such as the increased risk of death from heart disease could simply be
down to the fact that cardiovascular disease is the single biggest killer of
Australian women in the general population anyway,” she said.
“What the paper really needs to show is how the higher mortality figures were
explained – did they have higher BGLs for example?
“It is important that both men and women are screened regularly for diabetes
related complications as this will allow any problems to be identified early
and appropriate treatment initiated. Working closely with a diabetes
healthcare team to achieve the best possible blood glucose control can help
reduce the risks of complications such as cardiovascular disease and stroke in
