Did you know that diabetes puts you at greater risk of heart disease, even if
you have ‘normal’ looking cholesterol and no symptoms. This is because
diabetes can cause damage to your blood vessels.
Heart attacks and strokes are up to four times more likely in people with
diabetes, so this Heart Health Week provides a great opportunity to re-
evaluate how we can give our hearts a little extra love.
Looking after our heart health is not about depriving our bodies or cutting
out foods. There are actually foods that we want to have more of to boost our
heart health. Foods rich in soluble fibre for example can help naturally lower
total cholesterol levels. Such foods include fruit, vegetables, legumes
(pulses) like kidney beans, baked beans, lentils and chickpeas, oats
By starting your day with a small bowl of porridge, snacking on two serves of
fruit over the day, then adding extra veggies and legumes to your stews,
soups, salads or pasta sauces, you are on track to getting a good dose of
Fibre in food comes from the edible parts of plants. There are three different
types of fibre – soluble, insoluble and resistant starch. All varieties of
When increasing your soluble fibre it’s important to balance this with other
types of fibre by including foods like wholegrains, nuts, seeds and wheat

fuller for longer and help manage your blood glucose levels (BGLs). Win, win!

health, in addition to boosting your fibre intake.

* Include foods rich in healthy fats (mono- and polyunsaturated fat) such as avocado, nuts and seeds and most plant-based oils such as olive oil, canola oil, rice bran oil, avocado oil and macadamia oil.
* Aim to include two to three serves of oily fish over the week. Some examples of oily fish include tuna, salmon, mackerel and sardines.
* Choose fresh, less processed foods where possible. Limit high salt foods such as processed/packaged foods, canned products or sauces where possible. If selecting these go for those that say ‘low in salt’ or ‘no added salt’
* Incorporate flavours from herbs, spices, lemon or lime juice, vinegar and garlic rather than adding salt to cooking.
