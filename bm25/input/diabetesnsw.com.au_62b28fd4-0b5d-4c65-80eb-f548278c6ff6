When thinking about nutrition it’s helpful to use analogies, such as talking
about the body as if it were a car. Here we can think of the role of glucose
as our ‘petrol’ and our metabolism as a car’s revs.
Eating regularly timed meals keeps our ‘revs’ up and prevents our fuel tank
from ever running empty. Skipping meals on the other hand, makes our car run
sluggish and prone to bulging panels (weight gain).
The quality of the fuel you choose to fill your tank with impacts on how well
your engine runs, the number of kilometres to the tank, the pressure through
your valves (blood pressure) and your oil levels (cholesterol &
triglycerides). It can even affect your gas emissions!
 **In this analogy, an Accredited Practising Dietitian is like a GPS
navigation system or NRMA Roadside assistance. Our role is to help you
identify areas of your eating that could be modified and help bridge the gap
between where your health is now, to where you want it to be.**
If you are into tinkering, a great way to ensure good quality fuel goes into
your tank is to don your overalls and get hands-on in the kitchen. A recent
survey found 66% of men regularly experiment with new recipes and 42% more are
cooking more frequently at home. The popularity of cooking shows like
MasterChef appears to be the spark to ignite this passion.
At all times, remember you are in the driver’s seat and decide how fast or
slow you travel along the road of behaviour change, and whether you implement
We highly recommend checking in with a reliable and friendly mechanic (your
health professional team) on a regular basis to keep your car and diabetes
