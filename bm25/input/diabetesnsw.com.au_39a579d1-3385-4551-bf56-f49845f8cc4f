# Cells from umbilical cords re-programmed to create pancreatic islets
Australian researchers have used human stem cells to create viable glucose-
responsive pancreatic islets that may overcome the limitations of current
Islet cells developed at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research’s Storr
Liver Centre have shown biological activity when transplanted in animal
studies, according to initial results, published in _Nature_.
The stem cell derived islets have the advantage over human pancreatic islet
transplantation of being less immunogenic and thus avoiding transplant
rejection and the need for recipients to take immunosuppressant drugs for the
Investigator Professor Chris Liddle says their laboratory used stem cells
derived from human umbilical vein and human fat that were re-programmed to
“Pancreatic islets contain multiple cell types, not just insulin-producing
beta cells. The research team created three-dimensional HILOs that not only
include beta-like cells (the cells that produce, store and release insulin in
the islets of the pancreas), but also other supporting cell types found in
“Under the microscope, and using gene sequencing analysis, we are able to show
that the three-dimensional HILOs are very similar to human islets. When the
HILOs are transplanted into diabetic mice, they secrete insulin when blood
glucose levels are high, just as normal islets would.”
Human pancreatic islet transplantation is funded by the Australian Government,
but because of its limitations is currently limited to people with severely
unstable type 1 diabetes who experience recurrent and severe hypoglycaemic
The latest development was welcomed by Professor Philip O’Connell, Executive
Director at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research, who led Australia’s
first pancreatic islet transplantation trials 20 years ago.
Professor O’Connell, who was not involved in this research study, said human
pancreatic islet transplantation has saved hundreds of lives but has
limitations. For example, pancreatic islets are taken from deceased donors,
and the wait for donor islets can be lengthy. Once donor islets are obtained,
“This research indicates the potential to alleviate some of these issues. Stem
cells derived from readily available human tissues can be expanded then re-
programmed into potentially unlimited numbers of islets that are suitable for
Prof Liddle acknowledged that more research is needed before this approach is
“We believe this is a significant step toward an injection-free or device-free
future for people with type 1 diabetes,” he said.
