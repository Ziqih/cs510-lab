# Research looks at alternatives for blood glucose testing
Professor Paul Dastoor is leading the way in diabetes research as he and his
team work to develop a low-cost, saliva-based glucose test which could make
blood tests a thing of the past for people living with diabetes.
The needle free test integrates biosensors or chemical signatures into printed
transistors and detects concentrations of glucose that is up to 100 times more
Professor Dastoor from the University of Newcastle says the most futuristic
way it would work is that it could allow people to print their own sensor on
“You would get a cartridge potentially that you could print on a little piece
of plastic, cut it out and lick it. I expect it will plug into a low-cost
reader,” he said, estimating the cost of each device to be less than a cent.
Ultimately Professor Dastoor and his team hope the device would send the
“Where we are now then, is having the ability to create a really low-cost
sensor that we can print enormous quantities of which would be sensitive to
“The creation of the non-invasive test for diabetes has been described as the
Holy Grail in diabetes research for decades,” Professor Dastoor said.
Other non-invasive tests among the current methods being developed for people
living with diabetes include tattoos, sensors and breathalysers.
Diabetes NSW & ACT ambassador and General Manager of the Australian Technology
Park in Sydney, Duncan Reid has had type 1 diabetes for 29 years and says non-
invasive testing would be life-changing for people with diabetes who are at
“This sounds like a great way to test blood glucose levels, particularly for
people at work or even children at school where printers may be more readily
available,” he said. “I’ll be one of the first in line for it – I’m yet to
hear of someone who enjoys pricking their fingers to check their levels.”
Credentialled Diabetes Educator, Genevieve Biviano, said although the research
has been in development for eight years and has a patent on it, it is still in
“We certainly hope a non-invasive test for blood glucose levels will be
available on the market soon and we’re looking forward to hearing about the

An earring that monitors blood glucose levels and delivers feedback in real
time could change diabetes management for people living with type 1 diabetes.
