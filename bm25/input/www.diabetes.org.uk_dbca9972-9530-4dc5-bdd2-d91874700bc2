### Our privacy policy explains how we look after any information we have
about you, how it helps and why we need it. It makes clear how you can control
that information, including how we contact you, and what it means if we have
Collecting and processing personal information about you and other people
helps us run smoothly and meet our charitable aims. We use this information to
give you the best possible experience with us, whether that’s sending you
information as quickly as possible, telling you about our latest campaign or
We will never sell any information we have about you to third parties for
their own promotional marketing. You can change how, or if, we contact you at
#### We are Diabetes UK and we’re a registered charity. Find out more…
Our official name is the British Diabetic Association, but we’re usually known
as Diabetes UK, Diabetes Scotland, Diabetes Cymru/Diabetes Wales or Diabetes
Northern Ireland. We’re a charity registered in England (no. 215199) and
Scotland (SC039136) and a not for profit company (no. 00339181). Our head
office is in London and we have national offices in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. We have regional offices across England and run local
volunteer groups all over the whole of the UK. We also have a trading company,
Diabetes UK Services Limited, which carries out some of our commercial
activities like our online shop and our lottery to raise funds for the
charity. All of its profits are donated to the charity. Any personal data you
give us will be used by the charity and Diabetes UK Services Limited.
This privacy policy covers what we do as a charity generally, whether across
the UK, nationally, regionally or locally. Our use of data for recruitment and
employment purposes is dealt with in a separate policy. If you are a
researcher applying for a grant from us, please see our Research Privacy
We collect information directly from you, when you give it to us by filling in
forms, over the telephone, face to face, on your mobile phone or on our
website. This includes information you provide to our local volunteer groups.
We get some information about you from third parties, for example when you
enter an event organised by someone else and choose to fundraise for us. We
also collect some extra data about you from other sources.
When you provide us with your information directly, we usually ask you for
your name, address and contact details. If you are making a donation to us or
buying something from our shop, we will also collect your banking or credit
card details and may ask for information about your tax status for Gift Aid.
Often we also ask why you have chosen to support us, as that helps us
Where we are delivering services to you (for example through our telephone
helpline, events, community outreach, education and advocacy work) providing
you with information about our work or when you take part in one of our
campaigns, we regularly ask you for more information. This may be about about
your health, for example what type of diabetes you have, to make sure we send
you information which is right for you. It can also help us to have health,
dietary and disability information about you if we need to make changes to
meet your needs, like sending you audio publications or providing hypo kits at
events we run. We sometimes also ask about your ethnicity to make sure we are
reaching a diverse audience and because ethnicity increases your risk of Type
We work with the NHS and other organisations to improve the care and services
which people living with diabetes receive. To do this, we periodically ask
people living with diabetes to take part in surveys or audits about their
experience and the care they receive. If you agree to take part, we will give
you more details about how your information will be used and shared at the
If you volunteer for us, we may also collect details about your contact
details, age, gender, skills and experience, emergency contact details,
If you come to an event, meeting or workshop that we run, we will often take
photos to illustrate articles about them or for our future marketing. You can
always opt out of this by letting the organiser know. We’ll ask you for your
consent before using any close-ups or photos that are likely to identify you,
but it’s often not practical to get everyone’s consent for a group shot, for
example at a walking event or at a large conference.
#### Information we collect from you on our websites, social media sites and
Our Know Your Risk online tool collects information about your gender, age,
ethnic background, body shape and blood pressure to give you a score for your
risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in the next 10 years. This information is
kept separately from any other information you may give us and is only used by
We use a number of interactive online tools to deliver education and support
to you. Some of these ask you to give extra details about your personal health
and ethnicity as well as extra information about you like your diabetes type,
age, gender and date of diagnosis. This is so we can provide you with
educational content which is relevant, clinically accurate and suitable for
The Diabetes UK Support Forum gives people the chance to share their
experiences of living with diabetes and ask any questions. The forum is open
to the public and anyone using our website has access to the posts you make,
although we do moderate it to try to make sure it is a safe and supportive
space. Please see our Acceptable Use policy for more information.

We also use cookies and similar types of code to show you targeted information
from us when you leave our site and go to third party websites, for example on
Google and Facebook and their associated sites like Instagram and YouTube.
This means we can tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and aim to

If you’ve given permission to third parties to give us your data, we will
sometimes receive information about you from them. For example, when you sign
up to an event run by a third party, like running a race, and choose to
fundraise for us, we can receive information about you from the race
organisers or any fundraising sites you use like JustGiving, if you’ve agreed
they can share that information with us. Social media sites like Facebook,
WhatsApp and Google can also share your data with third parties, including us,
depending on the settings you’ve chosen on those sites.
We also collect a limited amount of extra information about you from public
and private sources, to give us a better idea of what you’re interested in.
This can include checking we’ve got your correct postal address from Royal
Mail. We might collect demographic data like age, using commercially available
survey data and databases like ACORN and the Eden Stanley Health & disability
tracker to predict some information about you or people similar to you.
Examples of information we may get are predictions about your likely
purchasing behaviour, motivations, attitudes, media usage, leisure interests,
how you engage with charities and indicators of financial status like house
value. This analysis will be based on your postcode and doesn’t relate to you
on an individual level. You can find out more about how we use this
information to serve you better in the understanding our beneficiaries and
We want to give everyone a great fundraising experience. To do this we
sometimes use information about your resources, positions of responsibility in
the public, private and third sector, location, charitable interests and
likelihood to give, personal interests and any other relevant information to
help us tailor communications and make sure we get in touch with the right
We collect information we can find on publicly available and free sources for
this purpose, like Companies House, other public registers, Who’s Who,
newspaper, magazine and internet articles. We always check that our resources
We receive information about legacies which have been left to us through an
automatic notification service. This draws information from grants of probate,
which are public documents, and allows us to get in touch with executors to
make sure we receive legacies intended for us. We’ll only use executors’
details for this purpose and we won’t send them any other information unless
If we have reason to think that someone who has never been in touch with us
before could be interested in our cause, we will collect basic information on
them from publicly available, reliable sources. We may have read their story
on a newspaper or know about them through our staff or major supporters. Once
we know a bit more about them, if we believe they might be interested we do
our best to get in touch with them, and we will usually do this within a
month, at which point we will provide more information about how we use the
We provide age-appropriate information for children and young people living
with diabetes on our website. We sometimes receive limited data about children
if they decide to fundraise for us, and we will collect data about children
for events we organise specifically for young people and their families or
where they agree to volunteer for us. Wherever possible, we will ask for
consent from parents to collect information about children and young people.
When we take photos of children at to our events, we’ll always ask parents if
When we work with third party suppliers or customers we will usually collect
limited contact details for key staff at that supplier or customer. These are
only used for managing our business relationship with that supplier or

* To make a decision about whether you are eligible to take part in a specific user experience project.
If you sign up for one of our events, like a fundraising event or support
event, we will use your contact details to provide you with information about
the event and to support you with any associated fundraising. If you join our
membership scheme, we will use your data to send you your membership benefits,
information about other ways to get involved with us and to make sure the
information we send you is relevant to you.
If you buy a product from our shop, we will use the information you provide to
complete your order. We will also use your details to ask you to fill in a
feedback survey via a survey agent about the products you’ve bought. We need
to share your information with our suppliers to do this, but we’ll keep your
data safe when we do this. Please see who we share your data with for more
details. If we notice that you’ve left items in your shopping basket without
checking out, we will send you an automatic reminder. If an item is out of
stock, you can also choose to receive a reminder when it’s back in stock.
If you apply for a research grant from us, our online grant application
platform is provided by CC Technology, a third party supplier. We will share
your data with experts involved in the evaluation of your application and we
will publish brief details of the awards we make. Please see the terms and
conditions of use of Grant Tracker, our Grant Conditions and our Research
privacy notice (PDF) for more details about how your data is used.
We provide a helpline for people living with diabetes, their family, carers
and friends or people who are worried they may be at risk of diabetes. Any
medical information you provide to the helpline is kept strictly confidential.
We only use this information to answer your questions and provide you with any
support you request, for staff training and quality assessment.
We also provide a customer care centre, which deals with a whole range of
other questions, issues and complaints about our work. We use the information
you give us to answer your questions, provide support to you or investigate
any complaints, for staff training and quality monitoring.
Some people agree to share their diabetes story with us to help us in our work
and to help other people who may have similar experiences. This may involve
you providing us with more detailed information about your health, background,
ethnicity, diabetes story and some photographs. We’re always really grateful
when people agree to get involved in our work in this way and we’ll always ask
you for your consent to use this information so that you stay in control of
#### Providing you with information about what we do and how you can help
Our charitable mission is that by bringing people together to work in
partnership, we will support those living with diabetes, prevent Type 2, make
research breakthroughs in diabetes, and ultimately find a cure. In order to
achieve our mission, we need to talk to as many people as possible about what
we’re doing. This is why we think it’s reasonable and legitimate for us to use
your contact details to contact you by post and by telephone to tell you more
about our work and how you can support us. This includes newsletters, appeals,
magazines, raffle mailings, event invitations and information about how we
help, campaigns we’re running, ways you can support us and about the research
we’ve funded. We also offer a variety of different e-newsletters which you can
sign up for. Some of these publications are supported by third party
advertising, but we don’t give your details to our advertisers.
If you’ve subscribed to the Telephone Preference Service, we won’t call you
about our work or for fundraising purposes unless you tell us that you’re
happy to hear from us in this way. We will only call you for strictly
necessary administrative purposes, like to check Gift Aid status or to respond
to a complaint you’ve made. We’ll only send you information about our work by
email if you give us consent to contact you by email. The same applies for
You can change the way you hear from us, or stop hearing from us, quickly and
easily at any time by contacting us. Please see details in the contact
It’s important to us to understand the likes, dislikes, needs and interests of
our beneficiaries, supporters and potential supporters. We do this in a number
We get extra information about you from other public and private sources
(please see information we obtain from other sources to get to know you
better). We look at how you support us and the amount and frequency of any
donations you may have made to us. This helps us to make sure that we’re only
asking for financial support when it’s appropriate to do so and we don’t ask
you too often. It also means that if we think you might be able and willing to
give a bit more, or to leave us some money in your will, we can contact you to
So we can assess your ability and likelihood to support us, we analyse the
information people give us and your relationship with Diabetes UK. Very
occasionally we do more detailed research on individuals. But this is the
exception not the rule. We only do it if we have reason to think someone is
particularly influential or might have the capacity to be a major donor to us.
This assessment is either based on personal interaction or on a more general
analysis of our database of contacts done by applying demographic data, social
factors, population and consumer behaviour (as mentioned above).
#### Analysing data to improve what we do
We often use personal information to analyse the success of our campaigns,
appeals and initiatives. This helps us make sure we’re reaching the right
people and having the greatest impact. It’s also useful to us to group our
supporters together in our databases on the basis of common interests or
characteristics. This is often known as segmentation or profiling. It helps us
to understand what kind of people take part in particular campaigns or
appeals, so that we can improve what we do. For example, we might find that a
particular group of people are more likely to drop out of our Swim22
challenge, so we can offer them extra support and encouragement. It allows us
to tailor our communications to make sure they are more relevant to each
group. For example we might learn that one group is more likely to be
interested in self-education to manage their diabetes, but aren’t interested
in cooking so we signpost them to our online Learning Zone content rather than
recipes. As a result, we can save money, by not sending out unwanted
communications. We can also use these groups to work out where some of our
messages aren’t being successful and try new ways to reach people to achieve
our charitable goals. While we may use profiling to target the way we
communicate with our supporters, our services are always available to everyone
If you’ve agreed to receive emails from us, we also track whether emails have
been opened and whether you’ve clicked on any of the links in those emails to
see if they were useful and interesting to you.
#### Applications to participate in user experience research
If you apply to participate in a user experience research project, our online
recruitment platform may automatically decide whether you are suitable to
participate. This decision is based on the data you provide during the sign-up
process. Each research project is different, and our sign-up process will
clearly explain who we are looking for and the reasons why. Your application
to participate in user experience research – whether accepted or not – has no
effect on any other involvement you have with us now or in the future.
We can’t do everything ourselves, so often we need to share your personal
information with third parties with the skill, experience and facilities to
deliver services to you and give you information you’ve requested. We may also
share your personal information with third parties so they can give us advice
or services to carry out our work. We’ll always make sure that your
information is kept securely and can’t be used for other purposes. If you sign
up for our user experience research, we will share your information with our
research clients so they can contact you to participate in research. We will
never sell or give your information to third parties for their own promotional
Occasionally we may be legally required to share information with official
agencies, regulatory bodies or the police to protect you or to prevent or
#### Providing information to you and delivering services
When we send out information to you, for example about our events, campaigns
or membership benefits, we often use companies who provide support services
like printing, creative services and mailing to do this. When you place an
order with our online shop, we need to share your contact details with our
suppliers, warehouse and logistics providers to complete your order. Your
details may also be passed to a survey provider for feedback on the products
you buy, so that we can improve the range of products we offer.
If you pay for products or for services or make donations online or over the
telephone, we will share your information with the payment providers who
process the payments for us, like Mastercard, Google Pay, Stripe or Apple Pay.
If you ask for support from us, we may give your details to local groups in
your area who can provide that support, but we’ll always ask you first if
We sometimes team up with other partner organisations like other charities,
healthcare organisations or companies where we have common goals. This often
allows us to achieve more than doing things on our own. We’ll always give you
the choice on whether your details are passed to our partners or not.
Like most charities, we may use professional fundraisers to carry out face-to-
face or telephone fundraising on our behalf. We always put in place
safeguards, like monitoring and call listening to check they are behaving in a
professional way and comply with the Fundraising Code.
We also use the services of online or mobile platforms for a number of
reasons, for example to manage registrations for the conferences and events we
run, to support fundraising efforts associated with these events, to support
campaigns, to manage grant applications, to manage mobile messaging and mobile
donations and to send out forms and surveys. When you submit your data to
these platforms, the platform will collect and send your registration details
to us. Sometimes the platforms will use your data for their own purposes such
as analysing the use of their platform or for advertising, so we recommend
that you check their privacy policies for more details.
Sometimes we share information about our supporters with third parties like
creative agencies and data analysts who advise us on how to create and improve
our campaigns and appeals. They may advise us on which groups of our
supporters are more likely to respond to particular communications, including
financial appeals and legacy requests. Any data will usually be shared on an
anonymised basis, but occasionally we may need to share more details to get
We always make sure that we have a robust legal agreement in place with our
third party suppliers, which obliges them to only use your information on our
#### Sharing information to and from social media
Reaching people through social media is a very cost-effective tool for
We sometimes share with Facebook the email addresses of people who have
donated to us, registered to take part in one of our fundraising events, or
engaged with us in another way. These email addresses are used by Facebook to
create ‘lookalike audiences’. These are groups of people with similar
characteristics and interests to our supporters, who might therefore be
interested in getting involved with us. We will then use Facebook to show
relevant advertising to these audiences. For example, we might find that
people who like walking are more likely to take part in our London Bridges
Walk. We do this to make sure we are using our funds in the most efficient and
cost-effective way possible, to reach and provide support to more people, and
raise more funds to aid our vital work for people living with diabetes. Any
information we share with Facebook will be shared in an encrypted format, and
will not be used for their own purposes. You can tell us at any time if you
don’t want your data to be shared in this way by contacting us. You can also
Some of the cookies and tags on our website come from third parties like
Facebook or Google. This allows them to collect information about pages which
visitors have visited on our website and show you advertising from us when you
go elsewhere on the internet. See our Cookies policy for more details and how
We use a platform called SocialSignIn run by Orlo to manage our social media
interactions. This helps us respond to you quickly and efficiently. If you
message us, tag us, like us, follow us, share or comment on our posts, your
personal data will be stored by Orlo on our behalf. Your data will be stored
securely and will only be used by us either to respond to social media
interactions or to help us work out how we can better communicate with our
supporters. Orlo won’t use your data for anything else.
To help us thank our supporters who fundraise for us on Facebook, we use a
platform called GivePanel. This allows us to understand who is fundraising for
us and post thank you messages on their public fundraising pages. To use this
tool, the data we receive from Facebook is shared securely with the company
that runs GivePanel. They can’t use this information for any other purpose and
From time to time we may offer you opportunities to engage as a participant in
user experience research via our website. ‘User experience research’ is the
process of getting feedback about products and services aimed at people with
diabetes, and is different to ‘clinical research’ that aims to scientifically
prove medical and lifestyle interventions. Although we will always consider
clinical research as part of our charitable mission, we also offer user
experience research as a chargeable consultancy service to other organisations
that we have vetted. We do this to raise funds for our work, but also to
encourage products and services targeted at people with diabetes to take into
If you choose to participate in any of our user experience research projects,
we may introduce you to our research clients and also share data with them
relating to your involvement in that user experience research project. Our
signup process will always let you know what data will be collected and shared
Involvement in our user experience research projects is your choice, and
requires your active agreement for each and every research project. We will
never share any data with our clients that we have collected from our other
activities with you, and we will never sell your data to anyone for their own
#### Information sharing required by law or regulation
Our services are confidential. However, we may share information you give us
with support agencies or the police if a member of staff or volunteer has
concerns about your own or someone else's safety or wellbeing. We would need
to share what you tell us with someone if:
* we believe your life or someone else’s life is in danger
* you tell us that you or someone else is being, or is at risk of being abused by another person
* it’s necessary to prevent or detect a crime
* we are required to do so under a court order.
Our work is based in the UK and we store the data we hold within the European
Economic Area (where you have the same level of protection for your data as in
the UK). However, a few of our suppliers may store their data outside the
European Economic Area. We will only transfer your data to them if we are
confident that your data will be adequately protected, for example if they
have signed up to the US’s Privacy Shield, which guarantees the rights of
European Union citizens, or if we have a contract with them that says they
We sometimes partner with third party marketing agencies to help us reach our
supporters better and we have recently partnered with Blis to provide geo-
This technique allows us to deliver digital advertising on some websites you
might visit, so the adverts you see are more relevant to you. We do this by
using GPS location data, where you have given consent to share this data.
You will always need to give Blis explicit consent to participate in this
technique and to allow them to use your data in this way. All of your
information will be processed and stored in accordance with Blis’ Privacy
You may opt out of advertising and processing of your data by Blis at any
time, and you can also directly contact Blis' privacy department to review,
correct, update, or subject to delete your data.
As diabetes is a long-term, chronic condition, we know that your needs for
support and your relationship with us will change over time. We will normally
keep your personal information only for as long as necessary.
We normally keep your details on our supporter database while we have an
ongoing relationship with you. If we haven’t heard from you for seven years,
we will archive your data, which means we won’t use it any more unless you
We keep recordings of calls to our helplines and complaints for two years,
except where we need to keep the data as a record of your consent to be
contacted by us, in which case we keep it for as long as we need it for
We keep financial records, Gift Aid records and details of any contracts we
enter into with you for seven years after the relevant transaction, which is
required by law. We do not keep your credit card details in accordance with

or concerns for longer periods of time in accordance with governmental,
If you’ve told us that you’ve left us a gift in your will or have expressed an
interest in leaving us a gift in your will, we will keep a limited amount of
information about your relationship with us until six years after your estate
is wound up. This information will be only used to make sure we receive any
We guard against unauthorised access to our systems by reviewing our
information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical
security measures. We restrict access to personal information to employees,
contractors and third parties who need to know that information to process it
for us and put in place contracts which require them to keep it confidential.
We regularly assess the security of our systems. If we need to transfer data
to or from third parties, we will always use a secure method to do so.
Organisations that collect personal data need to have a lawful basis for doing
so. The law sets out six ways to process personal data (plus extra conditions
for processing sensitive personal data). Five of these are relevant to the
This includes information that is processed on the basis of:
* A person’s consent (for example to send you direct marketing by e-mail or SMS)
* Diabetes UK’s legitimate interests (please see below for more information)
* A contractual relationship (for example to provide you with goods or services that you have bought from us, or when you agree to participate in user experience research)
* Processing that is necessary for meeting legal obligations (for example to process a Gift Aid declaration and carrying out due diligence on large donations), and
* In rare cases, to protect someone’s life.
Personal data may be legally collected and used if it is necessary for a
legitimate interest of the organisation using the data, as long as its use is
fair and doesn’t adversely impact the rights of the individual concerned.;
We will always consider if it is fair and balanced to use your personal
information and if it is within your reasonable expectations. We will balance
your rights and our legitimate interests to make sure that we use your
personal information in ways that are not unduly intrusive or unfair.
* Achieving our charitable aims –These include providing support and advice to people living with diabetes and its related complications and for those who care for them, increasing the understanding of diabetes, educating healthcare professionals and the general public and promoting research into the causes, prevention and cure of diabetes and publishing the results of research.
* Administration and operational management - This includes running the charity, legal and financial reporting and meeting legal requirements, , responding to your enquiries, providing information and our support, research, surveys, events management, the administration of volunteers and employment and recruitment requirements.
* Fundraising and campaigning This includes running campaigns and donations, sending and making direct marketing by post and phone, analysing data to make sure our work is effective and maintaining a list of people who don’t want to hear from us.

change our use of your personal data, please get in touch with us using the
You’re in control of your data and the way we use it.
You can ask us for a copy of the information we hold about you at any time by
contacting us at the details below. We will generally supply any information
you ask for within 30 days unless it is a particularly complex request. We
will not charge you for this information other than in exceptional
circumstances. We may ask you for proof of identity as we need to be sure we
are only releasing your personal data to you.
You can also ask us at any time:
* to stop using your data for a particular purpose, if you’ve changed your mind about it
* to limit the way we use your data
* to stop using your data for direct marketing (for example fundraising and campaigning appeals)
* to stop analysing your data to understand our supporters better or
We will do our best to follow your requests as long as we’re able to do so.
For example, if you’ve signed up to attend an event, we will still need to be
able to use your details to process your attendance. If you ask us to delete
your data, or to stop sending marketing information to you, we will retain
limited details on a suppression list (a list of people we can’t contact), to
make sure we don’t contact you again by mistake. In this case, your details
won’t be used for any other purpose. You can also subscribe to the Fundraising
Preference Service, which enables you to block communications from named
If you have any complaints about the way we collect and manage your data,
please let us know so we can address them. We have appointed a Data Protection
Officer to oversee the way we manage personal data. They can be contacted at
infogov@diabetes.org.uk. If you’re unhappy with the way we respond to any
complaint, you also have the right to complain to the Information
Commissioner’s Office which regulates the use of personal data in the UK at

We are Diabetes UK and we’re a registered charity.
Our official name is the British Diabetic Association, but we’re usually known
as Diabetes UK, Diabetes Scotland, Diabetes Cymru/Diabetes Wales or Diabetes
Northern Ireland. We’re a charity registered in England (no. 215199) and
Scotland (SC039136) and a not for profit company (no. 00339181). Our head
office is in London and we have national offices in Wales, Scotland and

volunteer groups spread across the whole of the UK. We also have a trading
company, Diabetes UK Services Limited, which carries out some of our
commercial activities like our online shop and our lottery to raise funds for
the charity. All of its profits are donated to the charity and any personal
data you provide to us will be used by both entities.
This privacy policy covers what we do as a charity generally, whether across
the UK, nationally, regionally or locally. Our use of data for recruitment and
employment purposes is dealt with in a separate policy.
We collect some information directly from you when you provide it by filling
in forms, over the telephone, face to face or on our website. This includes
information you provide to our local volunteer groups. We obtain some
information about you from third parties, for example when you enter an event

card details. On occasion, we also ask why you have chosen to support us, as
that helps us understand how we can meet your needs.
Where we are delivering services to you, providing you with information about
our work or when you participate in one of our campaigns, we may ask you for
more information about your health, for example what type of diabetes you
have, to make sure we send you information which is tailored to you. It can
also help us to have health information about you if we need to make
adjustments to meet your medical needs, such as sending you large text
publications or providing hypo kits at events we run. We sometimes also ask
about your ethnicity to ensure we are reaching a diverse audience and because
ethnicity can have an impact on your Type 2 diabetes risk.
As part of our charitable mission, we work with the NHS and other
organisations to improve the care and services which people living with
diabetes receive. To do this, we periodically ask people living with diabetes
to participate in surveys or audits about their experience and the care they
receive. If you agree to participate, we will provide you with further details
about how your information will be used and shared.
### Information we collect from you on our websites and apps
Our Know Your Risk online tool collects information about your gender, age,
ethnic background, body shape and blood pressure to give you a score for your
risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in the next 10 years. This information is
kept securely from any other information you may give us.
We operate a number of interactive online tools to deliver education and
support to you. Some of these ask you to provide additional details about your
personal health and ethnicity as well as additional information about you
(like your diabetes type, age, gender and date of diagnosis) to provide you
with educational content which is relevant, clinically accurate and suitable
The Diabetes UK Online Support Forum gives people the chance to share their
experiences of living with diabetes and ask any questions. The forum is open
and anyone using our website has access to the posts you make, although we do
moderate it to try to make sure it is a safe and supportive space. Please see

preferences with us, you will still see some content from us on social media,
as the social media site will select content for you based on other factors.
If you’ve given permission to third parties to give us your data, we will
sometimes receive information about you from them. For example, when you sign
up to an event run by a third party, like the London Marathon, and choose to
fundraise for us, we can receive information about you from the race
organisers or any fundraising sites you use such as JustGiving if you’ve
agreed they can share that information with us. Social media sites such as
Facebook, WhatsApp and Google can also share your data with third parties,
including us, depending on the settings you’ve chosen on those sites
We also collect a limited amount of additional information about you from
public and private sources, to give us a better idea of what you’re interested
in. This can include checking we’ve got your correct postal address from Royal
Mail, using demographic data like age, using commercially available survey
data and databases like ACORN to predict some information about you. Examples
of information we may get are predictions about your likely purchasing
behaviour, motivations, attitudes, media usage, leisure interests and
indicators of financial status like house value. This analysis will be based
on your postcode and do not relate to you on an individual level. You can find
out more about how we use this information to serve you better in the
We want to give everyone a great fundraising experience. To do this we
sometimes use information about your resources, positions of responsibility in
the public, private and third sector, location, charitable interests and
likelihood to give, personal interests and any other relevant information to
help us tailor communications and make sure we get in touch with the right
We collect information we can find on publicly available and free sources for
this purpose, like Companies House, other public registers, Who’s Who,
newspaper, magazine and internet articles. We always check that our resources
If we have reason to think that someone who has never been in touch with us
before could be interested in our cause, we will collect basic information on
them from publicly available, reliable sources. We may have read their story
in a newspaper or know about them through our staff or major supporters. Once
we know a bit more about them, if we believe they might be interested we do
our best to get in touch with them, and we will usually do this within a
month, at which point we will provide more information about how we use the
We provide age-appropriate information for children and young people living
with diabetes on our website. We sometimes receive limited data about children
if they decide to fundraise for us, and we will collect data about children in
connection with events we organise specifically for young people and their
families. Wherever possible, we will ask for consent from parents to collect
When we work with third party suppliers we will usually collect limited
contact details for key staff at that supplier.
We use the data you provide to us and the data we collect about you from other

If you sign up for one of our events, like a fundraising event or support
event, we will use your contact details to provide you with information about
the event and to support you with any associated fundraising. If you join our
membership scheme, we will use your data to send you your membership benefits,
information about other ways to get involved with us and to make sure the
information we send you is relevant to you.
If you buy a product from our shop, we will use the information you provide to
complete your order. We will also use your details to ask you to complete a
feedback survey via a survey agent about the products you’ve bought. We need
to share your information with our suppliers to do this, but we’ll keep your
data safe while we’re doing this. Please see the section about who we share
your information with for more details. If we notice that you’ve left items in
your shopping basket without checking out, we will send you an automatic
reminder. If an item is out of stock, you can also choose to receive a
If you apply for a research grant from us, our online grant application
platform is provided by CC Technology, a third party supplier. We will share
your data with experts involved in the evaluation of your application and we
will publish brief details of the awards we make. Please see our grant
conditions for more details about how your data is used.
If you are awarded a research grant from us we will share information about
your work with LifeArc for the purposes of monitoring and evaluating the
Diabetes UK is a member of Europe PubMed Central, and as per the contract, we
are required to provide details of awarded grants on an annual basis.
We will also provide details of all our research awards (which includes brief
details about award holders) to the Association of Medical Research Charities
(AMRC) for the purpose of reporting as per membership requirement.
If you are awarded a Diabetes UK grant, we will include details of your
project on our website and may refer to your research in other communications
channels. We may also share information about your research with potential
We provide a helpline for people living with diabetes, their family, carers
and friends or people who are worried they may be at risk of diabetes. Any
medical information you provide to the helpline is kept strictly confidential.
We only use this information to answer your questions and provide you with any
support you request, for staff training and quality monitoring.
We also provide a customer care centre, which deals with a whole range of
other questions, issues and complaints about our activities and the services
we provide. We use the information you provide to us via this service to
answer your questions, provide support to you or investigate any complaints,
Some people agree to share their diabetes story with us to help us in our work
and to help other people who may have similar experiences. This may involve
you providing us with more detailed information about your health, background,
ethnicity and diabetes story. We’re always really grateful when people agree
to get involved in our work in this way and we’ll always ask you for your
consent to use this information so that you stay in control of how this
### Providing you with information about what we do and how you can help
Our charitable mission is that by bringing people together to work in
partnership, we will support those living with diabetes, prevent Type 2, make
research breakthroughs in diabetes, and ultimately find a cure. In order to
achieve our mission, we need to reach as many people as possible and talk to
them about what we’re doing. We, therefore, think it’s reasonable and
legitimate for us to use your contact details to contact you by post and by
telephone to tell you more about our work and how you can support us. This
includes newsletters, appeals, magazines, raffle mailings, event invitations
and information about the services we offer, campaigns we’re running, ways you
can support us and about the research we’ve funded. We also offer a variety of
different e-newsletters which you can sign up for.
If you’ve subscribed to the Telephone Preference Service, we won’t call you
unless you tell us that you’re happy to hear from us in this way.
We know that filling up your inbox with unwanted emails is annoying, so we’ll
only send you information about our work by email if you give us consent to
contact you by email (we’re also legally obliged to get your permission). The
We respect the fact that it’s your choice to hear from us or not. You can
change the way you hear from us, or stop hearing from us, quickly and easily
It’s important to us to understand the likes, dislikes, needs and interests of
our beneficiaries, supporters and potential supporters. We do this in a number
We get additional information about you from other public and private sources,
to get to know you better. We look at how you support us and the amount and
frequency of any donations you may have made to us. This helps us to make sure
that we’re only asking for financial support when it’s appropriate to do so
and we don’t ask you too often. It also means that if we think you might be
able and willing to give a bit more or to leave us a legacy, we can contact
you to see if you wish to do so.
So we can assess your ability and likelihood to support us, we analyse the
information people give us and your existing relationship with Diabetes UK. We
sometimes do some more detailed research on individuals. But this is the
exception, not the rule: we only do it if we have reason to think someone is
particularly influential or might have the capacity to be a major donor to us.
This assessment is either based on personal interaction or on a more general
analysis of our database of existing contacts done by applying demographic
data, social factors, population and consumer behaviour (as mentioned above).
It’s also useful to us to group our supporters together in our databases on
the basis of common interests or characteristics. This allows us to tailor our
communications to make sure they are timely and interesting to each group. And
it helps us to save money, by not sending out unwanted communications.
If you’ve agreed to receive emails from us, we also track whether emails have
been opened and whether you’ve clicked on any of the links in those emails to
see if they were useful and interesting to you.
We also use some of this information to analyse actual or likely responses to
our campaigns and appeals so that we can continue to improve and achieve our
We can’t do everything ourselves, so sometimes we need to share your personal
information with third parties with the skill, experience and facilities to
deliver services to you and provide you with the information you’ve requested.
We also may share your personal information with third parties so they can
provide services and advice to us in our work. We’ll always make sure that
your information is kept securely and can’t be used for other purposes. We
will never sell or give your information to third parties for their own
Very occasionally we may be legally required to share information with
official agencies, regulatory bodies or the police to protect you or to
### Providing information to you and delivering services
When we send out information to you, for example about our events, campaigns
or membership benefits, we often use companies who provide support services
such as printing, creative services and mailing to do this.
When you place an order with our online shop, we need to share your contact
details with our suppliers, warehouse and logistics providers to fulfill your
order. Your details may also be passed to a survey provider for feedback on
the products you buy, so that we can improve the range of products we offer.
If you pay for products or for services online or over the telephone, we will
share your information with our payment providers who process the payments for
us, like Mastercard. We don’t keep a record of your credit card details.
If you ask for support from us, we may pass your details on to local groups in
your area who can provide that support, but we’ll always ask you first if
We sometimes team up with other partner organisations (for example other
charities, healthcare organisations or companies) where we have common goals.
This often allows us to achieve more than doing things on our own. We’ll
always give you the choice on whether your details are passed to our partners
Like most charities, we may use professional fundraisers to carry out face-to-
face or telephone fundraising on our behalf. We always put in place
safeguards, like monitoring and call listening to check they are behaving in a
professional way and comply with the Code of Fundraising Practice.
We also use the services of online platforms for a number of reasons, for
example to manage registrations for the conferences and events we run, to
support fundraising efforts associated with these events, to support
campaigns, to manage grant applications and to send out forms and surveys.
When you submit your data to these platforms, the platform will collect and
Sometimes we share information about our supporters with third parties like
creative agencies and data analysts who advise us on how to create and improve
our campaigns and appeals. They may advise us on which groups of our
supporters are more likely to respond to particular communications, including
financial appeals and legacy requests. Any data will usually be shared on an
anonymised basis, but occasionally we may need to share more details to get
We always ensure that we have a robust and legally compliant agreement in
place with our third party suppliers, which obliges them to only process data
on our instructions and in accordance with the law.
Reaching people through social media is a very cost-effective tool for
charities. We sometimes share names and e-mail addresses with social media
platforms in order to find people with similar likes and interests to our
supporter groups, who might be interested in getting involved with us. Any
information we share with social media platforms will be shared in an
encrypted format and will not be used for their own purposes. You can tell us
at any time if you don’t want your data to be shared in this way or you can
opt out by changing your social media settings. See our Cookies policy for
### Information sharing required by law or regulation
Diabetes UK services are confidential. However, we may share information you
give us with support agencies or the police if a member of staff or volunteer
has concerns about your own or someone else's safety or wellbeing. We would
need to share what you tell us with someone if:
* we believe your life or someone else’s life is in danger
* you tell us that you or someone else is being, or is at risk of being abused by another person
* it’s necessary to prevent or detect a crime
* we are required to do so under a court order.
Diabetes UK’s operations are based in the UK and we store the data we hold
within the European Economic Area (where you have the same level of protection
for your data as in the UK). However, a few of our suppliers may store their
data outside the European Economic Area. We will only transfer your data to
them if we are confident that your data will be adequately protected, for
example if they have signed up to the US’s Privacy Shield, which guarantees
the rights of European Union citizens, or if we have obtained contractual
assurances from them that they will meet EU data processing standards.
## How long we keep your information for
As diabetes is a long-term, chronic condition, we know that your needs for
support and your relationship with us will change over time. We will normally
keep your personal information only for as long as we have an ongoing
We keep recordings of calls to our helplines and complaints for two years,
except where we need to keep the data as a record of your consent to be
contacted by us, in which case we keep it for as long as we need it for
We keep financial records, Gift Aid records and details of any contracts we
enter into with you for seven years after the relevant transaction, which is
required by law. We may keep details about any actual, suspected or potential
criminal offences or concerns for longer periods of time in accordance with
We review our information collection, storage and processing practices,
including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorised access to
systems. We restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors
and third parties who need to know that information to process it for us and
who are subject to appropriate contractual confidentiality obligations. We
regularly assess the security of our systems. If we need to transfer data to
or from third parties, we will always use a secure method to do so.
Organisations that collect personal data need to have a lawful basis for doing
so. The law sets out six ways to process personal data (plus additional
conditions for processing sensitive personal data). Four of these are relevant
to the types of processing that we carry out.
This includes information that is processed on the basis of:
* (a) A person’s consent (for example to send you direct marketing by e-mail or SMS);
* (b) Diabetes UK’s legitimate interests (please see below for more information;
* (c) A contractual relationship (for example to provide you with goods or services that you have purchased from us); and
* (d) Processing that is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation (for example to process a gift aid declaration and carrying out due diligence on large donations)
Personal data may be legally collected and used if it is necessary for a
legitimate interest of the organisation using the data, as long as its use is
fair and does not adversely impact the rights of the individual concerned.
When we use your personal information, we will always consider if it is fair
and balanced to do so and if it is within your reasonable expectations. We
will balance your rights and our legitimate interests to ensure that we use
your personal information in ways that are not unduly intrusive or unfair.
* Achieving our charitable objectives – including delivery of our charitable purposes in providing relief, support and advice to people with diabetes and its related complications and for those who care for them, advancing the understanding of diabetes and educating healthcare professionals and the general public and promoting research into the causes, prevention and cure of diabetes and publishing the results of such research;
* Administration and operational management – including running and administering the charity, completing statutory and financial reporting and other regulatory compliance requirements, responding to solicited enquiries, providing information and our services, research, surveys, events management, the administration of volunteers and employment and recruitment requirements.
* Fundraising and Campaigning – including administering campaigns and donations, and sending and making direct marketing by post and phone, and analysis, targeting and segmentation of data to develop communication strategies and maintaining communication suppressions.
If you would like more information on our uses of legitimate interests or to
change our use of your personal data in this manner, please get in touch.
You’re in control of your data and the way we use it.
You can ask us for a copy of the information we hold about you at any time by
contacting us. We will generally supply any information you ask for within 30
days unless it is a particularly complex request. We will not charge you for
this information other than in exceptional circumstances. We may ask you for
proof of identity as we need to be sure we are only releasing your personal
You can also ask us at any time to:
* withdraw consent (where we are processing your data on this basis),
* limit the way we use your data,
* stop using your data for direct marketing,
* stop analysing your data to understand our supporters better, or
We will do our best to comply with your requests as long as we’re able to do
so. For example, if you’ve signed up to attend an event, we will still need to
be able to use your details to process your attendance. If you ask us to
delete your data or to stop sending marketing information to you, we will
retain limited details on a suppression list, to make sure we don’t contact
you again by mistake. In this case, your details won’t be used for any other
purpose. You can also subscribe to the Fundraising Preference Service, which
enables you to block communications from named charities.
If you have any complaints about the way we collect and manage your data,
please let us know so we can address them. We have appointed a Data Protection
Officer to oversee the way we manage personal data. They can be contacted at
If you’re unhappy with the way we respond to any complaint, you also have the
right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (which regulates
the use of personal data in the UK) or to the Fundraising Regulator (which
We use a platform called SocialSignIn run by Orlo to manage our social media
interactions. This helps us respond to you quickly and efficiently. If you
message us, tag us, like us, follow us, share or comment on our posts, your
personal data will be stored by Orlo on our behalf. Your data will be stored
securely and will only be used by us either to respond to social media
interactions or to help us analyse how we can better communicate with our
supporters. Orlo won’t use your data for anything else. You can find out more
