# Roche diabetes products to be available in supermarkets
Roche Diabetes Care Australia has announced that a range of diabetes
monitoring products will soon be available in Woolworths.
Products including Accu-Chek Instant S blood glucose meters, Accu-Chek Instant
test strips and Accu-Chek Softclix lancing products, will be nationally
available in the Health Aisle at Woolworths from March 2020.
Diabetes is the fastest growing chronic condition in Australia. There are
currently 1.7 million Australians are living with diabetes and a further 280
Jane Crowe, General Manager, Roche Diabetes Care Australia noted that while
the local pharmacy remains the key access point for products that are
reimbursed via the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS) and to seek
advice, for the many Australians who are not managing their diabetes
effectively, Roche did not want access to be a barrier.
“We are committed to innovation, not only in our product development, but also
in ways in which consumers can access them. Given this range is not reimbursed
via the NDSS, no form is required to purchase the products, enabling us to
establish the partnership with Woolworths and broaden availability.
“We are passionate about understanding the needs of people with diabetes and
offering them broad access to encourage regular self-management,” said Ms
Roche Diabetes Care has been developing diabetes technologies and services for
more than 40 years. For product information, please visit www.accu-chek.com.au
