* 1 tbsp lemon juice (fresh is best - you will need ½ lemon)
1. Cook brown rice in 2 cups of water (stovetop or rice cooker). Drain and cool. Tip: cook rice the day before and cool overnight in the fridge.
2. Thinly slice the shallots and capsicum. Combine vegetables, currents, cashews and cooled rice.
3. In a separate bowl prepare the dressing. Crush garlic and combine with oil, squeezed lemon juice and soy sauce. Whisk to combine and add to salad. Mix all ingredients well.
4. Serve immediately. Tip: If you are preparing in advance, keep currants, cashews and dressing separate until just prior to serving as the cashews will go soggy.
This salad is bursting with colour, textures, flavour and nutrition. Add a
wholegrain bread roll and it is the perfect light meal on a warm Spring day.
This refreshing fruit and mint medley is a great entertainer for warmer months
A salad with a zing that's more filling than it looks!
