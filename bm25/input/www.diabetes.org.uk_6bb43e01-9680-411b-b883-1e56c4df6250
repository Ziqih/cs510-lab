>>>>>>> ### What local groups told us in the 2019 activity report
>>>>>>> We know amount of time and effort goes into completing local group
activity reports each year. We want you to know that we look at this
information and strive to improve the experience that local groups have. We
wanted to share the key findings from 2019 with you:
>>>>>>> * Across the UK, local groups saw **over 13,000** people
>>>>>>> * As well as events like Diabetes Week and World Diabetes
Day, local groups got involved in a number of our campaigns including Fight
for Flash, Food Up Front and It’s Missing – all making a real difference to
>>>>>>> * Some activities included speaking to medical students
about living with diabetes, running cookery, fitness and exercise classes
throughout the year, hosting a bi-monthly patient forum and holding a drop in
clinic with local healthcare professionals in order to provide more
>>>>>>> * Some of your greatest achievements included speaking to
over 900 people over two days at a county fair, running successful events for
children and families to provide more support, increasing the number of people
attending meetings by moving to a more accessible venue and raising thousands
>>>>>>> You also told us about some of the challenges for people with diabetes
in your communities. There were a number of common themes across the UK, most
notably around access to emotional and psychological support for people with
diabetes. Our It’s Missing campaign has already put a lot of focus on this
hugely important area, and everyone at Diabetes UK is continuing to make sure
people with diabetes receive the access to all the care they need.
>>>>>>> We also asked you what support or guidance would help you best support
people with diabetes in your communities. A lot of responses focused on the
desire to network with other local groups, or visit their meetings. Whilst
this is more difficult at present, we would always encourage you to make
contact with other local groups near you and share your experiences. You can
find out the other groups nearest to yours on our postcode finder or by
contacting your local office. We’re also looking at ways to keep in touch and
allow you to network virtually and your local volunteering team will be able
to share news of any upcoming opportunities with you.
>>>>>>> You also told us you’d like more opportunities to attend training
sessions as well as online support, resources and templates. We have an online
training portal that has some basic training already available, and we’ll
continue to add to this in the future. If there’s anything you’d like to be
able to access, contact your local team and we’ll do our best to give you the
tools and information you need to run your group independently.
>>>>>>> Finally we'd like to thank you again, firstly for taking the time to
complete your annual returns because this information is hugely valuable. We'd
also like to thank you for all the ongoing effort that you give to Diabetes UK
through your local group, supporting people with diabetes in your communities
now more than ever. Your volunteering makes a huge difference to people’s
>>>>>>> ## What is the local group update?

sent to the main contact of each local support group, either by email or
through the post. It provides all the latest news, updates and developments
from Diabetes UK to ensure your group are kept informed. To opt into our

>>>>>>> Get in touch with your local volunteering team so we can change the
main contact for your group and take you off this mailing list. And if your
committee members change, remember to let your local volunteering team know

like to share your story, we would love to hear from you. Please email us at
