There are few articles that help normalise the anxiety many of us live with
while managing type 2 and living through COVID-19. The Black Dog Institute
recently published such an article, and as people living with type 2 diabetes,
it’s valuable to remember that the anxiety we feel, if controlled, is what
Feeling anxious in certain situations can help us avoid danger, it’s how we’ve
evolved to keep ourselves safe. Even if you are not typically an anxious
person, it’s common to feel some anxiety during periods of change or
If you’re feeling anxious or worried during this time, you’re not alone.
Anxiety is normal, and in some cases it can be helpful. For example, research
during past pandemics show that people who worry are more likely to do the
things that help to keep the virus at bay, like frequent handwashing.
However, sometimes anxiety can be unhelpful. Here are some practical ways that
you can keep feelings of anxiety at bay if you are starting to feel
1.**Channel your anxious energy into action: get informed, plan, and prepare**
We often feel anxious when events feel out of our control, and when we think
we don’t have the capacity, skills or ability to cope. Anxiety tricks us into
thinking about the worst-case scenarios in vivid and frightening detail.
Instead of worrying, try your best to focus on what’s under your control.
Equip yourself with the facts about COVID-19 from trusted sources. Follow
government advice and make a plan about what you and your family will do if
you need to be in isolation, or quarantine.
Being exposed to constant, alarming, anxiety-inducing stories convinces us
that there is something to panic about, and further perpetuates myths,
rumours, misinformation, uncertainty and anxiety. The more we read and hear
about it, the more frightening it becomes, and the less chance we have to
distract ourselves and do things that can take our minds off it.
Although it might be tempting to keep informed, or difficult to escape,
limiting your exposure to media, news, and social media about coronavirus will
3.**Cut down or stop the behaviours that are fuelling your anxiety**
There are certain actions, when performed frequently, that can fuel anxiety
about health, and germ-phobia. Focusing too much on bodily symptoms, and
relying on “Dr Google”, can consume one with anxious thoughts and panic.
Being aware of these behaviours, understanding how they’re making you feel,
and replacing them with more helpful coping strategies can alleviate
4.**Stay focused on the here and now, taking each day step by step**
Try to focus on the here and now- not the past and not the future. Live in the
moment and take one day at a time.
5.**Be aware of negative thoughts and don’t give them too much power**
Just because we’re thinking something, doesn’t always mean it’s true. When you
notice yourself worrying a lot, take a step back, and try to let worries pass
Get enough sleep, exercise, eat well, avoid smoking, excessive alcohol and
drugs. This will help protect your mental health and immune system.
It can make a huge difference when we share our worries with others, and
connect with other people who are supportive. Try to stay connected to
supportive people in your life so you feel less isolated and lonely. You might
need try new ways of connecting that you haven’t before.
When we help other people, it can also make us feel better. We are all in this
together so let’s try our best to be kind and compassionate to each other.
When you feel overwhelmed take a few slow, deep breaths to help you calm down.
If there are other things that help you relax (e.g., a walk or listening to
10.**If you’re feeling like you’re not coping, get professional advice**
It’s ok to ask for help. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by anxiety, seek
professional support. Psychological therapies can be done online, or remotely
via phone or videoconferencing, and are an excellent option if you’re in self-
isolation, or worried about going to a clinic.
Importantly, be assured that for most people, the anxiety will be temporary,
and will reduce over time, especially once the virus has been contained.
