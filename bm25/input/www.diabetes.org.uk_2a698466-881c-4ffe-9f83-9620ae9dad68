Diabetes UK’s Peer Support Programme is a volunteer led approach to learn more
about living with diabetes from people who understand what it is like to live
We offer the opportunity to meet others in your local area who are living with
diabetes, to share experiences and practical tips to live well with diabetes.
We are developing a network of Peer Support Groups for people to support each
other, in relaxed and informal sessions, facilitated by trained volunteer Peer
To find a Peer Support Group near you, or if you are interested in setting up
a group, please contact your local Diabetes UK office.

### How can a Peer Support Group help me?
Our groups offer space to discuss any worries people may have with others who
understand what they’re going through. You may also find that other members of
your group will find your experiences valuable in helping them manage their
own diabetes. You will have the opportunity to:
* learn more about diabetes and living with a lifelong condition
* support each other and make new friends.
* discover support and activities in your area
* get the latest factsheets and handouts on diabetes.
Even if you are managing your diabetes well, there is still lots that you can
gain from being part of a Peer Support group. Our group members have a range
of experiences - from those that are newly diagnosed, to those that have been
diagnosed for over 20 years, and each person will have slightly different
approaches to managing their diabetes to learn from.

> "If you have diabetes you might see a health professional for only four

> empowering – it helps them take back control of their lives."
