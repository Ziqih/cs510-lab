>>>>>>> Mary talks about how technology has made her life easier and her
diabetes more manageable, just one of the reasons she's been fundraising for
us for years. Mary hopes to drive our pioneering research forward – to find
better treatments and to ultimately find a cure for the next generation.
>>>>>>> I was 27 when I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes on Christmas Eve.
I’d been feeling poorly for several months. I was drinking bottles of lemonade
for England – you can imagine what that was doing to me. I’d had my ears
pierced and they hadn’t healed. I didn’t realise at the time that was a sign.
At the time, I was really busy on a project at work and if I’m honest, I was
>>>>>>> My granddad had type 1 and would have been an early recipient of
insulin. In those days the treatment was so basic. My mother said he could
>>>>>>> My mother urged me to go to the doctor and I was sent straight to the
hospital. It was not a good day to be diagnosed. They sent me home, but I’d
>>>>>>> They started me on insulin straight away. It was horrible in those
days. The needles were big and thick – like something you’d inject a horse
with – and you’d use them again and again. I was on porcine insulin and only
urine testing was available at home in those days. It wasn’t at all accurate,
>>>>>>> I had two injections a day. I had to eat the exact same amount at
every meal, at the same time every day. There was no flexibility.
>>>>>>> I was given a book – the British Diabetic Association (now called
Diabetes UK) handbook – and sent home. I was lucky, I was the first patient of
the newly appointed diabetic health visitor (that's what DSNs were called in
those days) at the hospital and she had just moved into the village where I
lived. Knowing how scared I was, she came around to support me and helped me
do my first injection. It was horrible. I hated it, and I was very resentful.
I don’t think I accepted having diabetes for a long, long time.
>>>>>>> Slowly, over the years, it’s got better. I got my first blood testing
machine when I was pregnant with my son. It was the size of a small laptop.
You needed a large amount of blood, and there was nothing to help you push the
needle in. It took two minutes to give a result. I was lucky and I had a very
>>>>>>> Since then, things have come on leaps and bounds. Injection pens were
an enormous development. Instead of having to draw up from a syringe, a vial.
>>>>>>> I’ve always been what’s called a ‘silent diabetic’. I hated people
making a fuss. I’d treat a low blood sugar on the sly. With hindsight, it was
>>>>>>> While everything is easier these days, type 1 diabetes will never be
easy. Because no two days are the same. If you have a good diabetes team, it
>>>>>>> I lost all my hypo symptoms about four or five years ago. That’s quite
common in people who have been diabetic for a long time.
>>>>>>> I then qualified for an insulin pump. I sort of hated it at first.
Sometimes it lights up and it shows through your clothes and you have tubing
that catches on things. But I had a pump failure a little while ago and I so
missed it. You don’t realise how much you can do with a pump until you go back
>>>>>>> The other thing that’s really helped me is the FreeStyle Libre (flash
glucose monitor) sensor. When I lost my hypo symptoms I made a lot of fuss and
kept asking for a Libre sensor. It had to be prescribed by a consultant and
mine was out of the country. Because of postcode lottery, I had to buy my own
for 18 months and they were expensive. Now I get it on prescription thanks to
>>>>>>> It just means that doing activity, like the One Million Step
challenge, you can check your blood sugar before you go walking and you know
if it’s going low. It is an incredibly useful tool. You do need to learn how
to use it though, because it’s measuring your interstitial fluid. It’s not
your blood. When I started using it I couldn’t understand why it was saying I
was hypo, but it was a delayed reading.
>>>>>>> The pump and the FreeStyle Libre sensor have been the most recent and
best developments for me, not just for managing my diabetes, but also for
>>>>>>> "The fact remains that every day is a challenge. You can have two days
apparently the same and one day your sugars are fine, the next day they're
spiking all over the place. Let's find a cure. I really would like the
children and young people diagnosed today to have a future where diabetes can
>>>>>>> ###How the One Million Step Challenge has impacted me
>>>>>>> Diabetes UK raises an incredible amount of money and they seem to be
the main researchers into diabetes in this country. I’d just love them to find
a cure. You see these little kiddies, on a pump, their mum too frightened to
go to sleep. Wouldn’t it be lovely to find a cure for them? That’s why I got
>>>>>>> I first saw the challenge advertised on Facebook three years ago. I
signed up, but I was recovering from a bad accident and I had to give up. I
could hardly walk down the road some days. It was the thought of raising money
for diabetes that pushed me to try again.
>>>>>>>> The following year, I walked and walked and walked. This year, I was
determined to do it again. I finished the challenge over a week early and
>>>>>>> Through the challenge, I’ve met such a lovely group of people. We
support each other. I think if you have a chronic illness, other people often
aren’t interested. If I can go on the One Million Step Facebook group and say
I’ve been having a rubbish day with my sugars and I’m really fed-up, I get
hints from other people about how they avoid hypos on long walks. It’s lovely.
>>>>>>> The One Million Steps Challenge has educated me. We’re a good group
and we teach each other a lot. I’ve not just met other people with type 1,
I’ve learned about type 2 as well. People say to me, ‘oh, you’ve got the bad
diabetes.’ All diabetes is bad. They’ve all got the same complications. When
you talk to people, you realise there aren’t many people whose lives haven’t
>>>>>>> A lot of people I’ve met through the One Million Step Challenge,
especially some of the people with type 2, their HbA1c is incredibly improved.
Some of them may be able to come off their medication. A lot of people have
lost weight, feel better, and have improved their blood sugars as well. It’s
really heartening to see the impact it’s had for some people.
>>>>>>> It was a nice thing to focus on during the coronavirus pandemic. You
get to know people who are out walking their dogs or whatever. Walking is
quite a nice way to keep in touch with people over lockdown. You get to see
people. I think this challenge has saved a lot of people’s sanity,
particularly for people who live on their own. They say that getting out and
making themselves go out has made a big difference. When you go on a regular
walk, you get to know people. You smile and say hello, pat their dogs. It’s
>>>>>>> It’s helped my diabetes management, too. If my sugar’s a bit high I’ll
go for a walk and it’ll bring my sugar down. Now in the evening, if I’ve eaten
something that’s set my sugar high, I’ll just go for a little walk and keep
checking it and when it’s started coming down I’d go home.
>>>>>>> This challenge has definitely changed my life. It’s been good for me
to do something for a cause I care about. I don’t want young people to go
>>>>>>> I think diabetes gets a bad press and because people can be judgmental
about it, it’s hard to raise money for.
>>>>>>> It’s important that we raise funds for technology, because it’s such a
help. I know Diabetes UK is trying to get the tech improved for everybody with
their Cheque for Tech campaign. My flash glucose monitor means that when I’m
out walking, I’m not having to stop and prick my finger and squeeze blood out.
I can just do it. We’re very lucky in this country to have the NHS and
>>>>>>> The fact remains that every day is a challenge. You can have two days
apparently the same and one day your sugars are fine, the next day they're
spiking all over the place. Let's find a cure. I really would like the
children and young people diagnosed today to have a future where diabetes can
