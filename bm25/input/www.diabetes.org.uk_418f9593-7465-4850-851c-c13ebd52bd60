### When you have diabetes, you're more at risk of heart disease. This is also
called cardiovascular disease (CVD) or coronary disease, and can lead to heart
Cardiovascular disease affects your circulation too. And poor circulation
makes other diabetes complications worse – like problems with your eyes and
That’s why it’s even more important to take good care of your heart when you
have diabetes. We’re here to explain why diabetes increases your risk of heart
problems, and how you can reduce this risk.

## Why does diabetes increase your risk of heart disease?
If you have high blood sugar levels for a period of time, even slightly high,
your blood vessels can start to get damaged and this can lead to serious heart
This is because your body can't use all of this sugar properly, so more of it
sticks to your red blood cells and builds up in your blood. This build-up can
block and damage the vessels carrying blood to and from your heart, starving
So keeping as close as possible to your target HbA1c level will help protect
your blood vessels and in turn your heart. Even mildly raised blood sugar
levels can, over time, put you more at risk.
Be in the know about your HbA1c and how to lower it if it's too high.
We've talked about the link between high blood sugar levels and your heart
health. But it's not all down to blood sugars. Blood vessels are also damaged
by high cholesterol (blood fats) and high blood pressure.
So you can help prevent damage to your blood vessels by looking after your:
Getting your HbA1c, cholesterol and blood pressure checked at least once a
year are part of the checks you should have if you have diabetes. These might
be delayed or happen differently at the moment because of the coronavirus
pandemic. Speak to your healthcare team if you are not sure how soon you need
By managing these three things, you'll be helping to manage your diabetes and
protecting yourself against heart complications. But there are lots of other
things you can do to reduce your risk of heart disease.
Here we’ll explain what can happen in your body to cause these heart
Let’s start with the major blood vessels in your body, these are your:
* arteries – they carry blood away from your heart
* veins – they carry blood back to your heart.
If these arteries and veins get damaged, it can be harder for blood to flow
around the body and get to the areas it’s needed.
If your cholesterol is too high, then the extra fat in your blood sticks to
the walls of your blood vessels. Over time, this fat hardens and is known as
plaque. Hard plaque can block up the blood vessels, which makes the space
narrower and leaves less room for blood to flow.
This is called arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis and is the most common
In the narrower space, blood flow slows down and causes some of the blood
cells to group together and clot. If a blood clot breaks away, it will travel
through your arteries and veins until it reaches a section too narrow to pass
This can starve the heart of oxygen and nutrients and this is what causes a
Not only does the blood struggle to flow through the blood vessels, but over
time atherosclerosis makes the walls of your blood vessels more rigid and less
elastic. This can lead to high blood pressure (also called hypertension) or
High blood pressure puts extra strain on your blood vessels too. That’s on top
of the strain from high cholesterol and high blood sugar.
Narrowing of the blood vessels can affect other parts of the body too, like
your arms or legs. It’s called peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and if left
untreated, can also lead to amputation. Find out more about reducing your risk
## Reducing your risk of heart attack or heart disease
The good news is, you can reduce your risk of having a heart attack or
* Get your HbA1c, blood pressure and blood cholesterol (blood fats) measured at least once a year as part of your annual diabetes review – make sure you get advice and support from your healthcare team to keep them within your target range.
* Don’t smoke. Smoking makes it harder for blood to flow around your body, especially to your heart. If you need help stopping, ask your healthcare team for more help or check out our information to help you quit.
* Eat a healthy, balanced diet to protect your heart – reducing how much saturated fat you have is a good place to start.
* Be physically active and do some regular exercise.
* If you’re overweight, try to get down to a healthy weight. Being within the right weight range reduces the strain on your heart.
* Take your medication as prescribed. Some medicines help to protect your heart by reducing high blood pressure and you may take these even if you don’t have any blood pressure problems.
And if you have any chest pain or pain when walking – call 999 straight away.
These could be signs of a heart attack.

"It’s all very well having your bloods taken but go back and ask about them –
what do the results mean? I make sure I get all my checks and by taking that
control myself, I'm reducing my risk of developing these complications."

We know people with diabetes are more at risk of developing heart problems, so
we need to find ways to reduce this risk. We're funding research on heart
disease and if it's successful, this research could open doors to developing
new drugs that reduce plaque build-up in blood vessels and protect people with
