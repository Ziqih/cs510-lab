# Australian study adds weight to hybrid closed loop advantages
A recent Australian study has added to evidence that a hybrid closed-loop
(HCL) insulin delivery system results in better glycaemic outcomes in people
with type 1 diabetes compared to user-determined insulin dosing and self-
The results come from a six-month randomised controlled trial involving 120
adults with type 1 at seven Australian centres, half of whom used the
Medtronic 670G system with a glucose sensor (Enlite 3) and transmitter (GST3c
MiniLink) to automate basal insulin delivery. This research was first reported
For the primary outcome of Time in Range (TIR), the HCL users (n=61) showed an
improvement from 55% at baseline to 70% at 26 weeks, compared to no change in
Secondary glucose outcomes also favoured the HCL user group, with less time in
each of the low and high glucose ranges, lower mean glucose, lower HbA1c, and
People who used the HCL system showed a modest reduction from 7.4% to 7.0% in
HbA1c during the trial, compared to no change in the control group.
There was a larger mean decrease in proportional basal insulin use with HCL
(-5.4% vs. control 1.9%) and a larger increase in proportional bolus insulin
use (HCL 5.0% vs. control -1.6%) by 26 weeks.
Users of the HCL system also showed improvement in some psychosocial outcomes,
such as diabetes-related satisfaction and wellbeing, but there were no changes
in treatment satisfaction, diabetes distress, sleep or cognition _._
There were 17 serious adverse events in the HCL group compared to 13 in the
control group. The nine adverse events related to the HCL device included four
Writing in _Diabetes Care_, lead investigators Dr Sybil McCauley and Professor
David O’Neal of St Vincent’s Hospital in Melbourne, said there was no
published evidence from a randomised controlled trial for the Medtronic HCL
The Australian trial differed from uncontrolled studies in using self-
monitoring of blood glucose as a comparator rather than sensor-augmented pump
They said the 15% difference in TIR with the HCL device would translate to 3.6
extra hours per day within the healthy glucose range for users compared with
the control group, and noted there was a relatively greater improvement in
The study authors said the trial had shown that the HCL system could deliver
clinically meaningful improvements in people with type 1, including people who
were not currently using technologies such as insulin pumps or continuous
This “refutes prior assumptions made by clinicians as well as experiences of
participants in a shorter trial, some of whom expressed that HCL could be ‘too
“For most people living with type 1 diabetes globally, this trial demonstrates
that HCL is feasible, acceptable, and advantageous,” they concluded.
However, they acknowledged that the trial had been done in a select group of
patients who received intensive support, and that people using the HCL system
required several healthcare visits for training in how to use the device.
Therefore, further evaluation is needed of models of care to support the
