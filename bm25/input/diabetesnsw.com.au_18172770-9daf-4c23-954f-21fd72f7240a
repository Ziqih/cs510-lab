# Hope for vaccine for type 1 diabetes
Scientists at Monash University offered hope for a vaccine that could help
prevent the immune system from triggering the development of type 1 diabetes.
The Herald Sun cited Monash University Associate Professor Ashley Buckle
saying they are currently studying a protein found in the brain and the
pancreas that changes shape as it turns itself on and off. The study also
revealed how the protein interacts with the body.
Diabetes NSW Head of Health and Education Services Kristen Hazelwood said the
new research could be a key crossroad for diabetes.
“This research could be the turning point for people living with and at risk
of diabetes as it could be the first step in finding new treatments and a
possible vaccine for type 1 diabetes,” she said.
GAD65 has previously been linked to type 1 diabetes because the body makes
antibodies against the protein, but the new findings show the body interacts
with the protein differently, depending if it is on or off, the Herald Sun
The protein has been used in past clinical trials, in an effort to find a
vaccine to protect against type 1 diabetes, which have been unsuccessful but
according to Professor Buckle this new research could change that.
Monash University will continue their studies on the protein as they analyse
how the protein interacts with a human antibody. To see more the Sun Herald
