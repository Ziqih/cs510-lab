mind. You may want to get on with managing your diabetes in your own way. Or
if you’re recently diagnosed, you may need time to digest all this new
information. Everyone’s situation is different and talking is often hard,
especially when it comes to your own health.
But opening up to people and explaining how diabetes affects your daily life
can be a real eye opener – for you and for your listener. Sharing the burden
of your diabetes will help you feel less alone with your diabetes. It can take

other people with diabetes could bring positive changes and help you work
through daily challenges, such as feeling anxious about blood sugar levels, or

start the conversation about telling people about your diabetes. Our tips will
support you and show you how to begin your conversations.
