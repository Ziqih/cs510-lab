# Weight loss can put Type 2 diabetes into remission for at least two years –
The latest findings of the Diabetes UK-funded Diabetes Remission Clinical
Trial (DiRECT) have revealed that more than a third (36%) of people with Type
2 diabetes who took part in the weight management programme, delivered in GP
The results were announced today at our Professional Conference and published
The new results build on the first year findings, announced in December 2017,
which showed that 46% of participants were in remission after twelve months. A
year later, 70% of those participants are still in remission.
Remission is closely linked to weight loss, 64% of participants who lost more
than 10 kilos were in remission at two years. Participants regained some
weight, as expected, between the first and second years of the trial. However,
those who were in remission after one year, and who had stayed in remission,
had lost a greater amount of weight on average (15.5 kilos) than those who
As well as resulting in remission for some people, there appear to be
additional benefits to taking part in a weight management programme overall.
These include a reported better quality of life, improved blood glucose levels
Understanding why significant weight loss results in remission of Type 2
diabetes is at the heart of DiRECT. Studies have so far revealed that weight
loss reduces the levels of fat inside the liver and pancreas, which in turn
leads to the pancreas ‘rebooting’ insulin production again.
By understanding the biology of remission, Professors Taylor and Lean believe
it should be possible to provide better care for people diagnosed with Type 2

> "These results are a significant development, and we now understand the

> Dr Elizabeth Robertson, our Director of Research said:
> “Remission of Type 2 diabetes can be life changing, DiRECT offers one
> potential solution, we are committed to working with the researchers and the

In DiRECT, people were defined as in remission if they had long-term blood
glucose levels (HbA1c) of less than 48mmol/mol (6.5%), without needing to use
