# Theresa May: "Type 1 doesn't change what you can do"
Despite showing the classic diabetes symptoms, Home Secretary Theresa May put
them down to her hectic schedule during the London 2012 Games. Now diagnosed
with Type 1, she reveals how she hasn’t let the condition affect her demanding
role.When she came down with a heavy cold in November 2012, Home Secretary
Theresa May’s first thought was that she should get it checked out by her GP.
Her husband had just had a similar cold that had developed into bronchitis, so
it made sense for her to get it looked at before the same thing happened to
her. But she had no idea that this was a visit to the GP that would change her
While she was there, she mentioned to her GP that she had recently lost a lot
of weight, though she hadn’t thought much about it and had put it down to
“dashing about” in her role as Home Secretary. But the GP decided to do a
blood test anyway. Suddenly, she was being told that she had diabetes.
The news came as a shock, though looking back she realises she had some of
theclassic symptoms. As well as the weight loss, she was drinking more water
than usual and making more frequent trips to the bathroom. But, it wasn’t
something she thought about much at the time. “That summer was the Olympics,
so life was in a different order,” she says. “There was a lot more going on,
She was diagnosed withType 2diabetes, but, when the medication didn’t work she
went for further tests and, eventually, the news came back that she hadType 1.
“My very first reaction was that it’s impossible because at my age you don’t
get it,” she says, reflecting the popular misconception that only younger
people get diagnosed with Type 1. In fact, one in five people diagnosed with
Type 1 are over 40 when they develop it. “But, then my reaction was: ‘Oh no,
I’m going to have to inject’ and thinking about what that would mean in
The change in diagnosis meant switching from taking tablets to two insulin
injections per day, which has now increased to four. And while she was already
aware of the condition – a cousin developed it as a teenager – like anyone
with diabetes, she had to quickly learn what managing it meant in practical
“I hadn’t appreciated the degree of management it requires and I hadn’t
appreciated, for example, the paradox that while everyone assumes diabetes is
about not eating sugar, if you have a hypo, then you have to take something
The Home Secretary has learnt to cope with her condition
And, while managing diabetes can be tough for anyone, juggling it with the job
of being Home Secretary presents unique challenges. “The extra issues for me
are that I eat out a lot,” she explains.
“I go to a lot of functions where I am eating and I speak at dinners, so that
brings an added complication. When I’m going to do a debate or speaking at a
conference, I have to make sure that I’ve tested and know where I am, so I can
Keeping on top of her condition has even led to her surreptitiously breaking
the House of Commons' strict rules on not eating in the Chamber.
“There was one occasion when I had been expecting to go into the Chamber
later, but the way the debates were drawn up meant I had to go in at 11am and
I knew I wasn’t coming out till about five,” she recalls. “I had a bag of nuts
in my handbag and one of my colleagues would lean forward every now and then,
so that I could eat some nuts without being seen by the Speaker.”
Yet, even though she is doing one of the highest-profile jobs in Government
and working irregular hours, Ms May does not see her challenge in managing her
condition as being greatly different to that of anyone else with Type 1.
“In basic management terms, it’s the same for everybody,” she says. “You have
to get into a routine where you are regularly doing the testing.”
Part of her approach to diabetes is being upfront about it. “I don’t inject
insulin at the table, but I’m quite open about it. For example, I was at a
dinner last night and needed to inject and so I just said to people: ‘You do
start eating, I’ve got to go and do my insulin’. It’s better to be open like
In part, her attitude to diabetes has been inspired by another prominent
person with the condition,Sir Steve Redgrave. When she was first diagnosed,
she was “very struck by” a quote on the Olympian’s website, in which he said
that diabetes had to learn to live with him, rather than him living with
diabetes. “I think that’s a very good way of looking at it,” she says.
Ms May has now joined Redgrave as one of the highest-profile people with
diabetes in the UK and, in her case, this happened literally overnight after
she did an interview with The Mail on Sunday. It was a huge news story that
was followed up by all the national newspapers and broadcasters. Even now, if
you type ‘Theresa May’ into Google, ‘diabetes’ is one of the options that is
For someone who had always kept her private life separate from her career,
having such an intense focus on such personal information wasn’t something she
relished. “I suppose it wasn’t that easy because I’m not somebody throughout
my political career who’s talked much about their personal life,”she says.
“I’ve always tended to rely on it being about the policies and politics and so
forth, and so it was quite a decision to come out and say it in that way.
“But, the reaction overall has been pretty positive. I’ve been interested in
the number of people, particularly in the six months after it became public,
who came up to me at events and talked about being diabetic and I still will
get people who come up and talk to me about it.
“Somebody did say to me that they were very surprised I’ve got diabetes
because I don’t lead a ‘dissolute lifestyle’. And, of course, I said: ‘I’ve
got Type 1 – it’s an autoimmune condition’. But, the reaction from people with
diabetes is that it’s good that somebody’s come out and said they have
Since her condition has been made public, Ms May has been interviewed about it
on BBC Radio 5 live and has lent her support to charity work. For example, she
has recently written to schools in her Maidenhead constituency about Diabetes
UK’scampaignto make sure schools understand the support they are legally
required to give children with Type 1 diabetes.
Above all, she hopes that by doing the demanding role of Home Secretary, she
can play a part in dispelling the myth that having diabetes has to hold people
Theresa May doesn't let her diabetes impact on her hobbies or her schedule
“I would like the message to get across that it doesn’t change what you can
do,” she explains. “The more people can see that people with diabetes can lead
a normal life doing the sort of things that other people do, the easier it is
for those who are diagnosed with it to deal with it.
“The fact is that you can still do whatever you want to do, for example, on
holiday my husband and I do a lot of quite strenuous walking up mountains in
Switzerland, and it doesn’t stop me doing it. I can still do things like that
“But, people who don’t understand it assume that the fact you have a condition
means there must be something you can’t do; that it must change how you live
"And, of course, it does change your life in that you have to make sure you've
got the right diet and that you’re managing your blood sugar levels, but,
beyond making sure you’ve got that routine, you just get on with other things
