(the 4 Ts), to make sure more children are diagnosed early.

* **Thirsty** \- Being really thirsty and not being able to quench the thirst
* **Tired** \- Feeling more tired than usual

Fifteen-year-old Fintan had been feeling unwell for months. After reading
about our 4 Ts campaign in a newspaper, his family went to the GP and asked
them to test specifically for Type 1 diabetes, and Fintan was diagnosed with
the condition. His mum Sarah says, "Without Diabetes UK's 4 Ts campaign,
Fintan could have fallen seriously ill, or even died. We're so thankful."
