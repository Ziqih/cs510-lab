Researchers at the University of Alabama have discovered a new drug candidate
that offers a major advance in the treatment for diabetes.
Tested on human and mouse pancreatic islets, mouse and rat cell cultures and
animal models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the drug significantly

A study published in the journal Cell Metabolism describes the strong anti-
diabetic properties of this newly designed chemical compound. The researchers,
led by Anath Shalev, M.D., director of UAB's Comprehensive Diabetes Center,
said that "compared to currently available diabetes therapies, the compound
may provide a distinct, effective and highly beneficial approach to treat
While the safety and efficacy of SRI-37330 in humans still remains to be
determined. It is highly effective in human islets, is orally bioavailable and
SRI-37330 was discovered through two decades of research by Shalev, followed
by high-throughput screening of 300,000 compounds and extensive medicinal
chemistry optimization at Southern Research, headquartered in Birmingham.
Diabetes affects two hormones - insulin and glucagon. In healthy individuals,
insulin helps cells take up glucose from the blood when glucose levels are
high, and glucagon helps the liver release glucose into the bloodstream when
glucose levels are low. In diabetes, insulin release is diminished, cell
sensitivity to insulin can decrease, and glucagon release is excessive. This
can cause a vicious cycle of escalating blood glucose levels.
SRI-37330 appears to act beneficially on pancreatic islets that produce the
Diabetes affects 425 million people worldwide. In the United States more than
30 million people live with diabetes, while in Australia the figure is 1.3
Diabetes is a growing epidemic. Each year 1.5 million Americans are newly
diagnosed. In Australia the figure is approx. 105,000.
The preclinical studies led by Shalev suggest that the potential drug
SRI-37330 could be beneficial in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, including
both lean and obese individuals. Also, diabetes appears to be a significant
People who have prediabetes might also benefit from the potential drug.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of SRI-37330 in reducing fatty liver in mice
suggested it might have potential in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease, which affects about 100 million people in the United States and
The path to discovery of SRI-37330 began 18 years ago when Shalev and
colleagues identified the protein TXNIP -; pronounced "tix-nip" - as the top
glucose-induced gene in human islets, which are the cell groups in the
pancreas that produce insulin and glucagon. This was followed by their work
showing that TXNIP negatively affected islet function and survival, suggesting
that TXNIP might play an important detrimental role in diabetes.
In previous research, Shalev and colleagues also showed that TXNIP was
increased in different mouse models of diabetes and in diabetic human islets,
and that deletion of the TXNIP gene protected mice from diabetes and had
beneficial effects on pancreatic islet biology. Altogether, these data
suggested that a search for a TXNIP inhibitor could provide a novel approach
Some of the details of the current study - which covers 10 years of work -
involve the inhibitory effect of SRI-37330 on the TXNIP gene. SRI-37330
inhibited activity of the TXNIP promoter by 70 percent, and it showed a dose-
RNA sequencing of isolated human pancreatic islets treated with SRI-37330
showed that TXNIP signaling was inhibited as demonstrated by a number of
upregulated and downregulated genes. It further showed that SRI-37330
specifically inhibited TXNIP, but not other members of the arrestin family or
general transcription. Importantly, the Shalev lab previously showed that non-
specific inhibition of TXNIP signaling by the calcium channel blocker
verapamil has beneficial effects in human subjects with recent onset Type 1
diabetes, suggesting that this approach might be translatable.
Of note, SRI-37330 is effective in reducing TXNIP in the nanomolar range, has
an oral bioavailability of 95 percent, shows no cytotoxicity in vitro and no
toxicity in mice, even at doses about 10-fold above its therapeutic dose, and
has already tested negative in Ames mutagenicity assays, CYP450 inhibition,
hERG inhibition and Eurofins SafetyScreen for off-target liabilities,
Strikingly, addition of SRI-37330 to the drinking water of obese diabetic
db/db mice, a model of severe Type 2 diabetes, led within days to
normalization of their blood glucose. Similarly, SRI-37330 also protected mice
from streptozotocin-induced diabetes, a model of Type 1 diabetes. Of note,
SRI-37330 achieved even better blood glucose control than two of the leading
"Together with the fact that SRI-37330 was also effective after the onset of
overt diabetes, as well as when just dosed twice a day by oral gavage, is
particularly promising and raises the possibility that SRI-37330 may
ultimately lead to a much-needed oral drug that could also be used for Type 1
diabetes," Shalev said. Surprisingly, SRI-37330 decreased blood glucose levels
primarily via lowering of serum glucagon levels and inhibition of basal
glucose production from the liver. This mode of action is very different from
Despite SRI-37330's reduction of glucagon release from pancreatic islets and
reduction of glucose production by the liver, the inhibitor did not cause any
low blood glucose events or create a hypoglycemic liability in mice, even in
In another surprising result - and in contrast to previous attempts to inhibit
glucagon function for the treatment of diabetes - the inhibitor dramatically
improved the severe fatty liver observed in obese diabetic db/db mice.
"This now raises the intriguing possibility that SRI-37330 might also be
beneficial in the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a complication
frequently associated with diabetes and/or obesity,” Shalev said.
"In summary," Shalev said, "our studies have identified a novel substituted
quinazoline sulfonamide, SRI-37330, that is orally bioavailable, has a
favorable safety profile and inhibits TXNIP expression and signalling in mouse
and human islets, inhibits glucagon secretion and function, lowers hepatic
glucose production and hepatic steatosis, and exhibits strong anti-diabetic
effects in mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes."
