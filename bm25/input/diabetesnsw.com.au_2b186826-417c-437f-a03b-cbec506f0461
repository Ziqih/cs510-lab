# New study boosts understanding of diabetes and ageing
In a surprising study, Oregon State University researchers found that no
matter how much stress they placed on mice from either a high-fat diet or
strenuous exercise, the animals’ mitochondria were able to adapt and continue
The findings could have major implications for the study of conditions like
diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, all of which are associated with an
impairment in the breaking-down and clearance of damaged mitochondria.
Mitochondria are the structures that house cellular respiration, the process
used to turn nutrients into energy. Dysfunction in mitochondria may lead to
lower energy production, greater inflammation and tissue damage. Yet as
central as mitochondria are to living organisms, scientists still don’t know
exactly what keeps them healthy – or makes them unhealthy.
"This study fits another piece into the puzzle", said Public Health and Human
Sciences researcher Matt Robinson, coauthor of the research.
“It helps lay some future groundwork for how we can optimize (muscle and
mitochondrial) health, to help with conditions like obesity and diabetes.
there are even some implications with ageing – conditions that we know have
compromised mitochondria,” Robinson said. “This might provide some new
pathways for how to improve the mitochondria and restore them.”
The study looked at a specific pathway, called autophagy, through which cells
recycle old mitochondria. Autophagy is thought to be impaired by a high-fat
diet but activated by exercise. The researchers intentionally blocked
exercise-induced autophagy in the mice for a period of time, but continued
They found that blocking a specific pathway to activate autophagy had no
negative effect on mitochondrial function in the muscle of the mice.
Next they tried upping the ante, adding a high-fat diet alongside the exercise
to further stress the mitochondria. And again, the mice were able to improve
their mitochondrial function even without the autophagy pathway, which shows
that mitochondria have alternative pathways to stimulate recycling and
The research team were surprised by how adaptable the mitochondria seemed to
“If these animals were given a high-fat diet, they got better at burning off
those fats. If they were given just the exercise, they were able to make more
mitochondria, which is good from an exercise perspective,” Robinson said. “And
Future research will extend to human subjects, looking at how autophagy
responds to diet and exercise in people, particularly those with obesity and
While weight is a major risk factor for diabetes, research has shown that
exercise is one of the strongest ways to help prevent or reverse development
“Even without changes in weight, exercise has this amazing ability to improve
Even single sessions of exercise improve metabolism if a person is obese and,
With the current study as well as past research, the team have found that
obese mice respond normally to nutrition and exercise, leading them to
conclude that there is no overt dysfunction or broken pathway; the muscle is
just responding to the stimuli it is given, whether from diet or exercise.
