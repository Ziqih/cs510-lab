Health experts today warned of the alarming increase in gestational diabetes
which in the past 12 months has affected 38,000 Australian women during
“In the last ten years, more than 200,000 women have developed gestational
diabetes. Latest projections show that over the next decade more than 500,000
women could develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy,” said Professor
Today (14 November) is World Diabetes Day and Diabetes Australia has warned
that gestational diabetes is now the fastest growing type of diabetes in
“Importantly, gestational diabetes poses a dual threat – firstly without
appropriate management and care, it can be a serious risk to mother and baby
during the pregnancy, and secondly it poses a serious future risk for both
mother and baby developing type 2 diabetes and other health issues,” he said.
“After gestational diabetes, women are at high risk of developing type 2
diabetes and children born to mothers who have gestational diabetes are also
at an increased risk of being overweight or obese, or developing type 2
“The alarming increase in number of women developing gestational diabetes
presents an intergenerational diabetes issue and threatens to make the type 2
“Our latest projections suggest that gestational diabetes could trigger over
250,000 women to develop type 2 diabetes or prediabetes in the coming decade.”
“Developing gestational diabetes is one of the biggest risk factors for type 2
diabetes and we need to ensure Australian mums and families get the support
they need after gestational diabetes to reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes.
We need to break this intergenerational cycle of diabetes.”
A/Professor Alison Nankervis, an Endocrinologist at the Royal Melbourne and
Royal Women's Hospital said the short term complications for mother and baby
can be serious, but the risk of complications can be reduced with good
“Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and
usually goes away after the baby is born. The abnormal blood glucose levels
can affect both the mother and baby,” A/Professor Nankervis said.
“The condition makes pregnancy higher risk for both. Babies born to mothers
with gestational diabetes are more likely to be born prematurely or via
C-section, be larger babies, have shoulder dystocia and a range of other
“Women with gestational diabetes may need intensive glucose management to
avoid serious problems. But with the best possible management and care, the
risks can be reduced and women can avoid complications."
A/ Prof Nankervis said growth in gestational diabetes was already putting
pressure on health services with the number of women with the condition
doubling at the Royal Women’s Hospital since 2014.
“There are a number of factors contributing to the growing rates of
gestational diabetes including the age women are falling pregnant, the
changing ethnic makeup of Australia’s society, and the weight of women when
they fall pregnant. The growth of gestational diabetes has been exacerbated by
recent lowering of the diagnostic threshold,” she said.
Professor Johnson said diabetes in pregnancy was a major priority in the
Australian National Diabetes Strategy 2016-20 but there was still no clarity
on the implementation plans from the Australian Government and the State and
“New approaches are needed for pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy, and after
“There needs to be help for women to be a healthy weight before pregnancy. We
need to improve access to diabetes education and support for women with
gestational diabetes during pregnancy as well as ensuring they are getting the
care and support they need after the birth.”
“This includes seeing their GP for follow up testing to detect type 2 diabetes
or prediabetes, and access to type 2 diabetes prevention programs and health
physiologists who can help with lifestyle management to reduce their risk of
“Sitting back and doing nothing is not an option. This is an avalanche that
will bury the health system if we don’t act,” he said.
