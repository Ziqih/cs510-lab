uses new technology called a hybrid closed-loop system to treat Type 1

No, the Medtronic MiniMed™ 670G and Medtronic monitors are called a hybrid
closed loop system. They are not an artificial pancreas because they don’t

cure for diabetes. You’ll still need to do a finger-prick test when you eat or
if you need a correction dose of insulin, and you’ll still need to carb count.
The hybrid closed loop system needs both the pump and a Medtronic CGM. The
pump and your monitor work together to keep your blood sugar levels in target.
This pump won’t work with other brands of CGMs, it has to be a Medtronic CGM.
The MiniMed™ 670G can suspend your insulin when your glucose levels are
