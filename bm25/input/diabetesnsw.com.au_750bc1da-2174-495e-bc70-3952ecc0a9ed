“The convenience and ease that FreeStyle Libre offers is hard to top, but
Abbott’s FreeStyle LibreLink app does exactly that. The app along with the
FreeStyle Libre sensor blends in seamlessly with life’s routine. It makes

Novo Nordisk Australia, sponsored the lighting of the Sydney Opera House to
help raise awareness about the significant health issue diabetes has become.
