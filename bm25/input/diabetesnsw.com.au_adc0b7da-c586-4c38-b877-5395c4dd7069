If you’re a fan of diet and sugary drinks a new study has found yet another
reason to consider ditching your favourite sugary soft drink.
A new study followed more than 450,000 people from 10 European countries for
up to 19 years and found those who drank two or more glasses of any type of
soft drink a day had a higher risk of dying from any cause of death than
people who drank less than a glass each month.
The study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, found men and
women who drank two or more glasses a day of sugar-sweetened soft drinks had a
higher risk of dying from digestive disorders, while those who drank the same
amount of diet drinks had higher risks of dying from cardiovascular disease.
The link to digestive disease in the study is interesting, said Dr Sharon
Horesh Bergquist, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University
"Experimental evidence suggests that high blood sugar and high sugar intake
can impair the gut barrier, leading to a 'leaky gut' and access to the gut
immune system causing intestinal inflammation, alter gut microbiota and
"These pathways may increase susceptibility to digestive diseases.
"Total soft drink consumption in the study was also associated with an
increased risk for Parkinson's disease, but not with Alzheimer's or cancer.
Soft drinks were defined as "low calorie or diet fizzy soft drinks", "fizzy
soft drinks," such as cola and lemonade, and "fruit squash or cordials," which
are non-alcoholic concentrated syrups typically mixed with sugar and water.
In this study, one glass of soft drink was 8 fluid ounces, or 250 millilitres;
the typical can of soda around the world holds 12 fluid ounces or 355

In February, the American Heart Association released a study that found
drinking two or more artificially sweetened drinks a day is linked to an
increased risk of clot-based strokes, heart attacks and early death in women
The risks were highest for women with no history of heart disease or diabetes
and women who were obese. Previous research has shown a link between diet
beverages and stroke, dementia, Type 2 diabetes, obesity and metabolic
syndrome, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes.
In March, a study published in the journal Circulation used data from 80,500
women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study and nearly 40,000 men from the
It found that women who drank more than two servings a day of sugary beverages
- defined as a standard glass, bottle or can - had a 63 per cent increased
risk of premature death compared to women who drank them less than once a
month. Men who did the same had a 29 per cent increase in risk.
Those who consumed more than one sugary beverage per month but fewer than two
per day seemed to experience a dose effect: The more they drank, the greater
Substituting one sugary beverage per day with an artificially sweetened one
was found to lower the risk of premature death, but drinking four or more
artificially sweetened beverages increased the risk of premature death from
The same effect was not seen for men, and it was not seen for the risk of
dying from cancer. While the studies above didn't see an association between
soft drinks and cancer, another study published in the BMJ in July did.
The research followed more than 100,000 French adults and found drinking just
a small glass of a sugary drink per day - 100 ml, about a third of a typical
can of soda - to an 18 per cent increase in overall cancer risk and a 22 per
This study, as well as other research on the connection between diet and
sugary beverages and health risks, is observational and cannot show cause and
That's a major limitation, researchers say, as it's impossible to determine
whether the association is due to a specific artificial sweetener, a type of
The cause behind these associations isn't clear," said Bergquist. "Other
potential biological causes could be attributed to experimental evidence
linking consumption of artificial sweeteners to sugar cravings, appetite
