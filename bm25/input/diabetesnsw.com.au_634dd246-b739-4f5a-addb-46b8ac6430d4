Diabetes is caused by damaged or non-existing insulin cells inability to
produce insulin, a hormone that is necessary in regulating blood sugar levels.
Many diabetes patients take insulin supplements to regulate these levels.
In collaboration with other international researchers, researchers at the
University of Bergen have, discovered that glucagon producing cells in the
pancreas, can change identity and adapt so that they do the job for their
“We are possibly facing the start of a totally new form of treatment for
diabetes, where the body can produce its own insulin, with some start-up
help,” says Researcher Luiza Ghila at the Raeder Research Lab, Department of
The results are published in Nature Cell Biology.
The researchers discovered that only about 2 per cent the neighbouring cells
in the pancreas could change identity. However, event that amount makes the
researchers are optimistic about potential new treatment approaches.
For the first time in history, researchers were able to describe the
mechanisms behind the process of cell identity. It turns out that this is not
at passive process, but is a result of signals from the surrounding cells. In
the study, researchers were able to increase the number of insulin producing
cells to 5 per cent, by using a drug that influenced the inter-cell signalling
process. Thus far, the results have only been shown in animal models.
“If we gain more knowledge about the mechanisms behind this cell flexibility,
then we could possibly be able to control the process and change more cells’
identities so that more insulin can be produced, ” Ghila explains.
According to the researchers, the new discoveries is not only good news for
“The cells´ ability to change identity and function, may be a decisive
discovery in treating other diseases caused by cell death, such as Alzheimer´s
disease and cellular damage due to heart attacks”, says Luiza Ghila
