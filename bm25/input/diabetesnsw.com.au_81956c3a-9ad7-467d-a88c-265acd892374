* What should I do if I have pre-diabetes?
* Care plans: what you need to know
* Type 2 diabetes and me – online course
I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was three years old in 2003. I
don’t remember much about it because I was too young to understand at the
It is hard but I’ve been handling it. I even planned a diabetes awareness day
at school. If people weren’t so harsh about it and judgemental, and other

I want to help people to understand what it’s like and know what it’s about,
and that they can talk to me if needed.
