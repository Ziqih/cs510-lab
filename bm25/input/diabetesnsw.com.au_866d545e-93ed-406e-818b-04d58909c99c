... Good health before conception leads to better pregnancy
# Good health before conception leads to better pregnancy

Maternal and child health in Australia, like most countries, has traditionally
focused on health during pregnancy and in the early years of life. But this
approach may be missing a key opportunity to improve pregnancy and birth
In a series of papers published this week in The Lancet, my research team
argues women’s health in the months and years before they become pregnant can
impact on their health during pregnancy and the baby’s development.
We’ve long known smoking and high alcohol consumption during pregnancy
increase the risk of low birthweight and pre-term birth (before 37 weeks),
which is linked to higher rates of heart disease and diabetes later in life.
Our new research shows obesity and poor nutrition can also increase the risk
of pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes, high blood pressure
and pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a serious condition that causes high blood
pressure and protein in the urine, and can result in impaired kidney or liver
It’s therefore important to encourage women to improve their lifestyle well
before they begin planning a family. In fact, this can begin in adolescence,
when many unhealthy habits – such as smoking, poor diet, and alcohol
Obesity increases the risk of a number of poor outcomes. These include
pregnancy complications for the mother, such as pre-eclampsia and gestational
diabetes, and problems with the baby, such as a low birthweight, a high
birthweight, or having congenital anomalies such as neural tube defects which
One possible mechanism is that the mother’s obesity elevates her levels of
glucose and insulin concentrations (the sugar in her blood), which drive the
growth of baby while still in the womb.
About half of women of child bearing age are overweight or obese in Australia.
Not only are these women at increased risk of high blood pressure, pre-
eclampsia and gestational diabetes during pregnancy, but we found substantial
additional risk for all women who gained weight prior to each pregnancy.
Even for women in the healthy weight range, a weight gain of more than 2.5% of
their body weight prior to pregnancy was associated with 2.7-times higher risk
of developing gestational diabetes compared with healthy weight women who did
Diet influences body weight and nutrition. This is not just an issue for low-
and middle-income countries. Even in high-income countries, diets are
typically high in refined grains and sugars but lack important nutrients such
In the analysis of dietary data from the United Kingdom, almost all women of
reproductive age had iron and folate intake levels below daily recommendations
A national health survey data from Australia shows 40% of women (aged 14 to 50
For both the UK and Australia, over nine in ten young women consume fewer than
the five portions of fruit and vegetables per day – which is well below the
Sometimes it’s difficult to achieve sufficient nutrient intake through diet
alone. This is the case for folate, which plays a critical role in early
Taking folic acid supplements in the two to three months before and after
conception results in up to 70% reduction in the risk of defects in the brain,
spine, and spinal chord (with spina bifida being the most common). As a
result, folic acid supplements are already part of established guidelines for
Our research shows women with a healthy, balanced diet in the three years
before pregnancy are less likely to get gestational diabetes, high blood
pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. A balanced diet includes a high
intake of fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and fish, and low intake of red
Physical activity has a protective role for women and their babies. Even four
hours of brisk walking per week before pregnancy seems to lower the risk of
gestational diabetes. Yet many women of reproductive age fail to reach
recommended levels of physical activity. Less that two thirds of women aged
between 26-30 years get the recommended 30 minutes of physical activity per
Women need time to reach health or lifestyle objectives well before
conception. Reaching a healthy body weight, in particular, may require a far
longer period over months or years, rather than weeks. ![The
