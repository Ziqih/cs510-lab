>> # Scotland updates on Covid-19 information for people with diabetes
>> ### This page is specifically about guidance for people affected by
diabetes in Scotland. We'll continue to share relevant information provided by
the Scottish Government, NHS Scotland and other providers.
>> We have more information and advice about how coronavirus (Covid-19) can
affect people living with diabetes, including what to do if you become unwell
and what self-isolating and shielding mean. This is being updated regularly

>> Guidance states that everyone should continue to work from home if
possible. The Scottish Government has **published guidance for how to return
to work safely** where this is not possible. You can also access the
**guidance for individual risk assessment for the workplace**.
>> The Chief Medical Officer wrote to everyone on the shielding list during
the week beginning 4 January to set out further advice. If you are on the
shielding list but cannot work from home, if you live or work in an area in
lockdown, **you should not go to work**. The letter you will receive from the
Chief Medical Officer acts as a fit note for as long as lockdown restrictions
are in place. This letter is called a shielding notification and can be shown
to your employer without the need for a GP fit note.
>> **We encourage everyone who with diabetes to get their flu jab this year.
In the coming weeks, notifications should be sent to all those who are
eligible for a flu jab with instructions on how to get your jab. This may be a
different process to previous years. More information can be found on theNHS
>> Diabetic Retinopathy Screening is resuming with people who are a higher
priority invited for appointments first. Routine screening will recommence

Further information can be found on NHS Inform.

to be extra vigilant in taking care of yourself at home, be aware of any new
symptoms and contact your healthcare team if you have any concerns.
