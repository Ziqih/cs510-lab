# National Diabetes Week focuses on early detection
National Diabetes Week will soon be here. This year between 9 – 15 July the
focus will be on raising awareness about the early detection of diabetes.
Each day 290 Australians are diagnosed with diabetes, but too many people are
being diagnosed too late. Whether it's type 1 or type 2, this delay in
diagnosis is putting many people at risk of major health problems.
Every year as many as 640 Australian’s end up in hospital with dangerously
high blood glucose levels because the early symptoms of type 1 diabetes -
severe fatigue, thirst and weight loss - are not recognised. Around half of
these hospital admissions are children and teens and if not diagnosed in time
In addition, almost half million Australian’s are living with are living with
type 2 diabetes but don’t know it. That’s because the condition is “silent”
and can occur without obvious symptoms. When type 2 diabetes goes undiagnosed
there is the danger of developing complications like damage to the eyes or
kidneys, foot ulcers and even damage to the heart.
Diabetes doesn’t discriminate. That’s why this National Diabetes Week we’ll be
working to raise awareness of the signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Because with earlier detection we can reduce the risk of Australian’s
developing life threatening health problems and in turn save lives.
