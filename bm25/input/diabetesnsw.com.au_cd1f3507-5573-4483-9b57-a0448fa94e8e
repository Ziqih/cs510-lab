Hot Australian summers are the perfect setting for a barbeque with friends and
family. But rather than settling for an uninspiring table of poor quality,
processed meats – why not wow your guests with these five sizzling barbeque
tips for a fresh, colourful and healthy spread?
* Choose leaner cuts and trim away the visible fat – try chicken breast without the skin and lean cuts of beef, lamb or pork.
* Opt for reduced fat sausages. Far from being bland these varieties are usually loaded with great flavours and are sure to be a hit! Stick to thin varieties and prick with a fork while cooking so the excess fat can drain away.
* Try seafood such as grilled salmon, barramundi and prawns. They are bursting with Omega-3. Serve with a squeeze of lemon for a refreshing boost.
* Aim for a quarter of your plate to come from healthy protein foods
* Make your own burger patties and add your own healthy twist – try adding grated carrot or zucchini for a veggie boost or adding cooked lentils or mashed kidney beans for a fibre boost and delicious nutty flavour. Use lean mince and add onion and your favourite herbs and spices to up the flavour and nutrition.
* Aim for half your plate to be full of salads – they are the perfect way to fill up and cool down on those hot summer days. Try making a few different salads, noone will want to miss out and you’ll naturally up your veggie intake.
* Take your salads to the next level by add lots of colour and variety – there are endless combinations to try. Have a look at our website for inspiration.
* Try adding corn on the cob to your barbeque – it gives the corn a delicious, smoky flavour and increase your veggie intake at the same time!
* Impress your guests with a veggie stack – start with a flat mushroom and then add layers of pumpkin, eggplant, capsicum, zucchini and red onion. Top with cherry tomatoes and fresh herbs.
* Make colourful vegetarian skewers with onion, capsicum, zucchini and cherry tomatoes or alternate your veggies with lean meats.
* Prawns are quintessentially Australian and go beautifully on skewers. They are naturally low in kilojoules but packed with nutrition. Serve with a squeeze of lemon or a dash of garlic.
* Fruit kebabs are a delicious sweet treat for the afternoon – serve fresh for a revitalising burst or barbeque to caramelise the natural juices.
* There’s no need to add oils to your barbeque. Most models have a non-stick coating, making your barbeque even healthier!
* Cook on the grill rather than the hot plate so excess fat can drain away.
* Avoid overcooking or charring your meats – research has shown this can increase your risk of some cancers.
* Use lemon, garlic, herbs, spices and chili to create a taste sensation rather than oils and salt.
