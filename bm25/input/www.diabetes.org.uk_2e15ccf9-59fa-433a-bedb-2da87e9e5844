colleagues and manager about their condition. But being open can help you give
The best way to get informed about diabetes and how it affects someone is to
ask them. They live with the condition every day and will be able to let you

People with diabetes usually don’t think of it as a disability. But the law
often decides that it is. That’s because it’s a long-term condition that can
seriously affect someone’s ability to do normal day-to-day things if it’s not
This means diabetes is nearly always covered by the Equality Act 2010, or the
Disability Discrimination Act 1995 if you live in Northern Ireland. This act
says an employer needs to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ so that someone with a

Most people can manage their diabetes so it doesn’t affect their work. This
takes careful planning and resourcefulness. It can mean taking medication at
specific times and checking blood glucose (blood sugars) throughout the day.
For some people with diabetes, this can mean injecting insulin and pricking
Some people can feel awkward about injecting in public and even feel
embarrassed. Reassure your colleague that you understand what they’re doing
and it’s not a problem. If you manage them, help them find somewhere
appropriate to do it, so they don’t feel the need to hide in the toilet.
Some people with diabetes are at risk of something called hypos, when their
blood sugars go too low. Ask them what symptoms to look out for and what to do
if they ever need help treating a hypo.
If someone tells their employer they have diabetes, the employer may have a
legal obligation to make ‘reasonable adjustments’, so they can manage their
Reasonable adjustments might be making sure they have their breaks at set
times, so they can keep on top of their blood sugar levels, or providing
special equipment if they have eye problems. Reasonable adjustments don’t have
to cost money – they are more about taking a flexible approach to work.
If you manage someone with diabetes, ask them if you can do anything to
support them at work. They may say no, but diabetes can affect people in
different ways over time. So make sure they know they can discuss their
diabetes regularly in one-to-ones and appraisals if they want to.

## Time off work for illness and check-ups
People with diabetes need to go to several healthcare appointments a year.
They’re an essential part of managing diabetes and help reduce the risk of
serious complications. There’s also an annual review with their healthcare
team, which is vital in helping them manage their diabetes.
If you manage someone with diabetes, it’s vital you give them time off for
these essential checks. Check your policies on managing people with long-term
health conditions and approving time off for medical appointments.
When people with diabetes get illnesses like a cold, flu or stomach bug, they
may need to do extra checks, such as checking their blood sugar levels more
often, checking they aren’t dehydrated and managing what they eat carefully.
They may need extra support from their healthcare team. So allow them time to
get better and provide flexible working options if appropriate as they return
Discuss this with your company's occupational health team if you have one.
Stress can slow down their recovery even further and can affect their diabetes
## Time off work for a diabetes education course
Education courses are available for people with diabetes to help them
If you manage someone with diabetes, encourage them to go on an education
course, even if it means time off work. They may be entitled to time off for
Courses like DAFNE (for Type 1 diabetes) and DESMOND (for Type 2 diabetes)
make a big difference to how well someone with diabetes can manage their
condition. They can improve a person’s health in the long term and reduce time
off due to complications. And if people share what they’ve learned with
colleagues, this awareness can spread across your whole organisation.

People with diabetes are usually allowed to drive. However, there are extra
rules that depend on which medications they take and which driving licence
We have more information on driving with diabetes. And there’s a lot more
guidance available from the DVLA (or DVA in Northern Ireland).
To increase their chances of having a healthy baby and keeping safe, pregnant
women with diabetes need extra support. They must take extra care of their
health at all stages of pregnancy. They’ll have more appointments from pre-
conception onwards. They’ll probably need extra scans and will need their
Some women who don’t have diabetes before pregnancy develop gestational
diabetes during pregnancy, which means they also need extra care and more
appointments. Gestational diabetes usually goes away not long after the baby
is born, but women are at increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in the
So if you manage a pregnant woman with diabetes, talk about whether you need
to make some extra reasonable allowances. These might include flexibility
around working hours and some time off for appointments. Take the lead from
them and be available to discuss any issues they might have.
It’s hard being diagnosed with diabetes. And it’s often hard living with it.
Be aware of any challenges your colleague is facing and be there for them if
Stress and stressful situations at work (things like interviews, increased
workload, threat of redundancy) can cause raised blood sugar levels and make
it harder for someone to manage their diabetes. It can become a cycle of
negative feelings that can leave someone feeling low and even lead to
depression. We’ve got lots of information about stress and diabetes – take a
look to make sure you’re in the know and can support your colleague.
If you manage someone with diabetes who might be struggling like this, discuss
if any reasonable adjustments at work could see them through this bad patch?
If they need professional help, they should speak first to their doctor or a
member of their healthcare team who could arrange for them to see a
counsellor. If you have an employee assistance programme or in-house
counsellor, you could point them there too. You can also recommend our
## Can I help prevent my colleagues getting diabetes?
You can’t prevent Type 1 diabetes, but staying healthy by eating well and
exercising regularly can reduce people’s chances of getting Type 2 diabetes.
Think about introducing fruit and healthy snacks alongside (or instead of)
cakes and biscuits. You could start up a lunchtime exercise class or walking
group. If you manage people, give them regular breaks so they can step away
Use your intranet and other internal communications channels to raise
awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle in preventing conditions
## Can organisations refuse to employ someone with diabetes?
There are a few jobs or roles where safety-critical work may mean that you
would need to carefully assess someone’s ability to carry it out because of
their diabetes or the way that it is treated. In most cases, diabetes won’t
Employers are not allowed to have a blanket ban on employing people with
diabetes. The one exception to this is the armed services which is exempt from
the Equality Act 2010. In the emergency services (fire, ambulance and police),
each local service has its own rules, but they must risk assess the role and
look at each individual case. It is important that those conducting the
assessment have both an understanding of the role and of diabetes and how it
