## Get the most out of your appointments
There’s nothing worse than coming out of an appointment feeling that it was
too rushed. Or that you’re leaving with questions you thought were too stupid
Prepare a bit before you go and it’ll make all the difference.
* You could bring a list of your regular checks with you and tick off what you’ve had. Remember you can ask about anything that’s due or not booked in yet.
* You could write down any questions you think of and bring them with you. Run through them again at the end to make sure nothing’s been missed. And feel free to ask for time to write things down during the appointment too – like results, medical terms, or things for you to follow up on at home.
* If you’d feel better having someone with you then that’s fine, bring them along. Sometimes that can really help if you’re the type of person who worries afterwards about what was said and if you’d understood it all.
* And try to be honest. There’s no point in being vague or pretending you’re doing better at something than you are. Be honest and clear so that you get the care you need.

If you want a second opinion on the treatment you’re getting, your healthcare
team will be more than happy to ask their colleagues to see you. Or you can
ask your GP for a new referral to a new team.
If you’re not happy with the care or advice you’re getting from a member of
your healthcare team, ask the GP practice, hospital or clinic for a copy of
their complaints procedure. It’ll tell you who to complain to and if there’s

Most GP surgeries and diabetes clinics will have an out-of-hours service. Make
sure you know what the numbers are so you can call if you need to.
If there isn’t an out-of-hours service and you live in England, Scotland or
Wales, call 111. It’s a free NHS helpline for urgent medical help.
If you’re very ill, go to a hospital Accident and Emergency department
