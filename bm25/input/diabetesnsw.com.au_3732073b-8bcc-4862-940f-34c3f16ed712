# Is dietary fibre the key to a longer life?
Two recent studies from University of Otago researchers have shown eating more
dietary fibre improves life expectancy, although food processing may remove
One study using data collected from 8300 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes
found those with a higher fibre intake had a significant reduction in
premature mortality compared to those eating lower levels of fibre.
Lead author Dr Andrew Reynolds says people consuming 35g of fibre per day have
a 35% less risk of dying early compared with people who eat 19 grams of fibre
His advice is to increase fibre intakes by eating more wholegrains, legumes,
vegetables, and whole fruit applies to people across the globe.
“Try a few different ways to increase your fibre intake, see what works best
“If you eat white refined bread or rolls, try changing to wholegrain bread or
rolls. Try brown rice, try brown pasta, try adding half a tin of legumes to
“Try an extra vegetable with your main meal – fresh, frozen, or canned without
The research team also analysed 42 trials with 1789 participants where adults
with prediabetes, type 1 or type 2 diabetes were given more fibre and
They found consistent improvements in blood glucose control, cholesterol
levels and reductions in body weight when adults with prediabetes, type 1 or
type 2 diabetes increased their fibre or wholegrain intake.
Senior author Professor Jim Mann has been involved in diabetes research for
more than 40 years and led the first controlled trials of high fibre diets in
“When our controlled studies confirmed the benefits of dietary fibre four
decades ago, we never suspected that they would be quite so impressive,” he
“It has taken 40 years of research and these meta analyses to be able to show
that this dietary treatment can have an effect as striking as that produced by
In the second study, researchers found not all foods that contain fibre are
created equal – while wholegrains are an important source of fibre, their
For this study, Dr Reynolds and Prof. Mann led a trial in adults with type 2
diabetes to consider the effects of food processing on the health benefits of
Participants ate minimally processed wholegrain foods such as wholegrain oats
and chunky grainy bread for one fortnight, then more processed wholegrain
foods such as instant oats and wholemeal bread for another fortnight.
“Wholegrain foods are now widely perceived to be beneficial, but increasingly
products available on the supermarket shelves are ultra-processed,” says Prof.
Researchers used cutting edge glucose monitors to record participant blood
glucose levels over the day and night during the two-week intervention
Results showed improved blood glucose levels after meals and reduced
variability of blood glucose levels throughout the day when participants
The results were most striking after breakfast, as that was when most of the
Although participants were asked not to lose weight by eating less during the
trial, results showed their average weight increased slightly after two weeks
of eating processed wholegrains and decreased slightly after eating minimally
These two studies, along with previous research, confirm choosing high fibre
foods such as wholegrains, whole fruit, dark leafy greens or legumes is good
for everyone, and important in managing diseases such as type 1 or type 2
“However, we are now beginning to understand that how foods are processed is
also important, and for wholegrains when you finely mill them you can remove
