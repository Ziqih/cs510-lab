Harry Schwarz from 'Makibe Australia' organised a corporate golf day, which
raised $4000 to support those living with diabetes. Harry said “ I don’t think
people really know what a problem diabetes has become. Every person you meet
either has it or knows someone who does”.
Organising and running a Corporate Golf Day takes a lot of work and effort. On
behalf of all those living with diabetes and their family, thank you to Harry
