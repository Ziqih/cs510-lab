### When you have diabetes, you're more at risk of cardiovascular disease,
A stroke is when blood can't get to your brain and it's starved of vital
oxygen and nutrients. This can happen if your blood vessels are damaged or
blocked and we're here to explain why having diabetes means you're more at
But the good news is, you can reduce this risk and we'll take you through this
Let's start with your blood vessels. You've got millions of blood vessels all
over your body and they carry blood cells to and from your heart. If you have
too much glucose (sugar) in your blood for a period of time, your blood blood
This is because your body can't use all of this sugar properly, so more of it
sticks to your red blood cells and builds up in your blood. This build-up can
block and damage the vessels carrying blood around your body, starving the
So keeping as close as possible to your target HbA1c level will help protect
your blood vessels. Even mildly raised blood sugar levels can, over time, put
Be in the know about your HbA1c and how to lower it if it's too high.
We've talked about the link between high blood sugar levels and risk of
stroke. But it's not all down to blood sugars. Blood vessels are also damaged
by high cholesterol (blood fats) and high blood pressure.
So you can help prevent damage to your blood vessels by looking after your:
Getting your HbA1c, cholesterol and blood pressure checked at least once a
year is part of your 15 Healthcare Essentials and your legal right. If you're
not getting these, give us a call and we'll help you get the care you're
By managing these three things, you'll be helping to manage your diabetes and
protecting yourself against heart complications and stroke. But there are lots
of other things you can do to reduce your risk.
Let’s start with the major blood vessels in your body, these are your:
* arteries – they carry blood away from your heart
* veins – they carry blood back to your heart.
If these arteries and veins get damaged, it can be harder for blood to flow
around the body and get to the areas it’s needed, like your brain.
If your cholesterol is too high, then the extra fat in your blood sticks to
the walls of your blood vessels. Over time, this fat hardens and is known as
plaque. Hard plaque can block up the blood vessels, which makes the space
narrower and leaves less room for blood to flow.
In the narrower space, blood flow slows down and causes some of the blood
cells to group together and clot. If a blood clot breaks away, it will travel
through your arteries and veins until it reaches a section too narrow to pass
This will starve the brain of oxygen and nutrients and this is what causes a
Over time, atherosclerosis makes the walls of your blood vessels more rigid
and less elastic. This can lead to high blood pressure (also called
High blood pressure puts extra strain on your blood vessels too. That’s on top
of the strain from high cholesterol and high blood sugar. The more stress your
blood vessels are under, the harder it is to push blood around the important
areas of your body. This means they're seriously at risk.
Signs of a stroke are things like weakness in your face or arm, or slurred
speech. If you notice any of these signs, call 999 straight away.
But the good news is, there are things you can do to reduce your risk of this
* Get your HbA1c, blood pressure and blood cholesterol (blood fats) measured at least once a year as part of your annual diabetes review – make sure you get advice and support from your healthcare team to keep them within your target range.
* Don’t smoke. Smoking makes it harder for blood to flow around the vital parts of your body. Check out our information to help you quit.
* Eat a healthy, balanced diet – start by cutting down on salt.
* If you’re overweight, try to get down to a healthy weight. Keeping to a healthy weight reduces the strain on your body.
* Take your medication as prescribed. Some medicines help to protect your body by reducing high blood pressure and you may take these even if you don’t have any blood pressure problems.
We've got more information about reducing your risk of having a heart attack
too – it's all very similar advice as they're closely linked.
We've funding research to help us understand how blood vessel damage leads to
serious complications, like sight loss and stroke, in people with diabetes.
