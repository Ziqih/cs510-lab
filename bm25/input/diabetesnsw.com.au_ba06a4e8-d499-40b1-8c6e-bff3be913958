... Green exercise: the benefits of getting outside
# Green exercise: the benefits of getting outside
Australia truly is the lucky country. Even in our largest cities we are not
far from nature and open green spaces. Research shows that this may work in
our favour in more ways than one. Outdoor exercise or “green exercise” is
shown to offer a unique set of benefits when compared to the indoor variety.
Green exercise refers to any physical activity that occurs outdoors in natural
environments. With the weather warming up and the luxury of longer days at our
disposal, let’s look at what outdoor exercise has to offer!
One study showed that people who exercised regularly outdoors typically did 30
minutes more per week when compared to people who exercised indoors. Not only
did they exercise for longer, they also had better adherence to their exercise
program. People generally report finding outdoor exercise more enjoyable and
satisfying. This can in part be attributed to the extra stimuli outdoor
environments provide our senses. Natural landscapes provide us with
interesting sights, sounds and a varying terrain that can’t be replicated in a
gym. Visual distractions provided by outdoor environments have also been shown
to reduce ratings of perceived exertion with exercise meaning that it feels
There is a growing amount of evidence that supports the benefits of being in
nature whilst exercising. Doctors overseas are now beginning to prescribe
spending time in nature to their patients to assist in managing various
chronic conditions, especially those related to mood and mental health. The
act of simply looking at a green space can reduce hormones related to stress,
We know exercise in any kind of environment is beneficial for our mental
wellbeing, but outdoor exercise may provide additional mental health benefits,
especially when it comes to managing stress, anxiety and our mood. One theory
is that outdoor exercise may reduce neural activity to the area in our brain
(called the subgenual prefrontal cortex) which is responsible for, amongst
other things, repetitively processing negative feelings and thoughts (also
known as ruminating). Test this theory for yourself. Next time you are feeling
stressed, try some outdoor exercise like a local walking trail, park or public
garden that is away from the urban sprawl.
The varying terrain that outdoor exercise offers also means that different
muscle groups are incorporated during the activity. Uneven terrain means more
stabiliser muscles are required and our balance, coordination and reaction
time is challenged in more ways than on a standard treadmill or exercise bike.
Your traditional cardio equipment requires repetitive movement at our joints,
whereas outdoor exercise promotes more diversity in movement.
Outdoor exercise will also help boost your levels of vitamin D which is an
important vitamin in assisting with the absorption of calcium and maintaining
bone health. Over 30% of Australians have some form of Vitamin D deficiency.
This can increase the risk of bone and joint pain, as well as chronic
diseases, such as osteoporosis, heart disease, and some forms of cancer. It is
important to note that the amount sun exposure required to produce adequate
levels of Vitamin D is quite low. In summer it is recommended that the best
time to top up your Vitamin D levels is during the mid-morning or mid-
afternoon which also aligns with a good to exercise to avoid the hotter parts
At the end of the day our bodies reward us for all forms of movement,
regardless of whether it is indoors or outside. If you find yourself getting
bored of your current exercise, why not give your routine a spring clean
moving into the warmer months. Try incorporating some outdoor activities or
exercise options throughout the week such as walking trails, bushwalks,
hiking, cycling or finding green spaces in your local area to do some
