# NDSS product changes from 1 December 2018
More than 600,000 people with diabetes are set to benefit from cheaper access
to products under changes to the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS).
From 1 December 2018 the cost of items listed on the NDSS such as blood
glucose test strips (BGTS), urine test strips and insulin syringes will be
reduced. Some people with diabetes who use these products will save up to
$126.50 per year. More information about the cost savings can be found here.
Some existing brands of blood glucose test strips and insulin syringes will no
longer be available. You can read about which products are changing here.
There will be a transition period, from 1 December 2018 to 28 February 2019.
During the transition period, you may be able to purchase existing brands that
are being removed from the list of products available through the NDSS. You
will only be able to purchase these brands while existing community pharmacies
stock is available. It is likely that available stock may reduce over the
transition period as pharmacies sell their available stock. If you require
assistance in changing brands, you may wish to consult your healthcare team
People with diabetes registered on the NDSS will be eligible to receive a free
blood glucose meter associated with your preferred new brand of blood glucose
test strips. With respect to the new blood glucose meters, people are
encouraged to discuss the most suitable options with their health care
