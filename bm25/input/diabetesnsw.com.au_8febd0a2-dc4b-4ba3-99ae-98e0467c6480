A new national program is set to ease the strain of type 1 diabetes on
families by helping to ensure that principals, teachers and school staff have
the support, training and tools they need to support students with type 1
According to the findings of a recent survey one in every four parents of a
child with type 1 diabetes attends the school at least once a week to
Professor Greg Johnson, CEO Diabetes Australia said, “There are around 11,000
school students with type 1 diabetes across Australia so this is an enormous
burden. Every one of these students may need insulin injections or other
“The new Diabetes in Schools program, funded by the Australian Government and
part of the National Diabetes Services Scheme, signals a new era in school
support for kids with type 1 diabetes and their families. It will provide an
integrated package of information, training and support for parents and
families, schools and staff, and health professionals to better support
students with type 1 diabetes,” Professor Johnson said.
“We have consulted extensively with school principals, teachers and the
education sector who clearly indicated they wanted more support, training and
tools to help them support students with type 1 diabetes.”
The national survey of parents revealed the serious issues and impacts of type
1 diabetes on the school experience of these children:
* 25% of parents have to visit school at least once a week to administer insulin
* 65% of children with diabetes had a low or high blood glucose episode at school that required the parent to attend the school
* 71% of children were unable to attend school because of a diabetes-related issue
* 53% of parents believed diabetes had impacted on their child’s ability to fully participate in school activities
* 10% of the children visited the doctor or emergency department because of a severe diabetes episode at school
* Students with diabetes missed an average of more than two weeks of school a year as a result of type 1 diabetes
* 49% of parents believe school staff are not adequately trained to support children with type 1 diabetes.
Professor Johnson said the results painted a clear picture of why the Diabetes
“Principals, teachers and school staff do a great job – but it is clear that
more training and support is needed” he said.
The new Diabetes in Schools program will provide nationally consistent support
“Level 1 is basic introductory information about type 1 diabetes that all
school staff should have. This will be available through a new web portal that
provides access to a range of tools, resources, information and support to
help school staff to better understand how to support students with type 1
“Level 2 support and training is available for school staff who are directly
involved in supporting students with type 1 diabetes. This can be access
through online modules (for all schools) or group education workshops (in some
States). Training covers type 1 diabetes and food, monitoring glucose levels,
“Level 3 support offers face-to-face training at the school which is
individualised for a particular student and provided, where possible, by a
health professional from the student’s diabetes treating team (often a
“It will cover all key aspects of support for that student including glucose
monitoring, insulin administration and glucagon administration. This training
will be prioritised to schools with students who are newly diagnosed with type
1 diabetes or require support to administer insulin.
“Level 3 services will be delivered by some of Australia’s leading paediatric
diabetes centers and will roll out progressively across Australia commencing
## Ensuring the health and safety of children with type 1
Professor Johnson acknowledged and thanked the Health Minister, Hon Greg Hunt
MP for supporting and funding the new national program.
“This is a key issue in ensuring the short- and long-term health of children
with type 1 diabetes and we’d like to thank the Australian Government and
Health Minister Greg Hunt for funding this vital initiative,” he said.
The Diabetes in Schools program is built on extensive consultation with
principals, teachers, parents and health professionals and provides a range of
tools, resources, information, training and support to help schools support
