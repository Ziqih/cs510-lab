### There are extra rules for people with diabetes who want to drive. This is
to make sure it’s safe for you and others. This information is about what to
tell your driving licensing authority when you have diabetes.
We’ve campaigned for years to make sure the law is fair. So that you can carry
on driving – as long as you’re taking the right steps to stay safe at the
The rules differ depending on what vehicle you want to drive:
* To drive a car or motorbike, it’s called a Group 1 driving licence.
* To drive a bus or lorry, it’s called a Group 2 driving licence – the laws are a lot stricter.
The rules are complicated, so use the tables below to find the information you
need. If you understand the rules, you’ll know when to contact your relevant
If you live in England, Wales or Scotland, it’s the Driver and Vehicle
Licensing Agency (DVLA) who look after the rules on driving.
If you live in Northern Ireland, it’s the Driver and Vehicle Agency. To make
things easier, we’re going to use DVLA throughout this information.
They both have the same rules, but the DVA only uses paper forms, while the
When you're applying for your provisional licence, there will be a part on the
form to fill out about your diabetes. Make sure you don't wait until you have
passed your driving test to tell the DVLA or DVA about your diabetes.
When you have your driving lessons it's a good idea to tell your driving
instructor that you have diabetes as you'll need to check your blood glucose
They look at your fitness to drive based on how you treat your diabetes and if
It’s really important that you follow these rules as soon as they start
applying to you. For example, you should stop driving and contact the DVLA as
soon as you find out you have to take insulin for the long term or if you
start to develop complications. If you don’t, you’re breaking the law.
**In all cases, if you have one severe hypo at the wheel you must stop driving

## More than one severe hypo while awake (when you’re not driving)
If you have more than one severe hypo while awake in 12 months you must stop
driving and tell the DVLA. Your licence will be revoked but you can apply
again after three months. See your healthcare team to get their advice on your
diabetes treatment and management to cut down the risk of this happening
To be clear, this is about more than one severe hypo when you’re not driving.
If you have even one severe hypo while driving, you must stop driving and tell
The law about severe hypos while sleeping changed for Group 1 licences (cars,
motorbikes) after we campaigned for the DVLA to recognise they aren’t a risk
for driving. You can’t take the same steps to treat them that you can when
The DVLA now say you don’t need to tell them if you have a severe hypo while
It isn’t the same for Group 2 licences (for large vehicles and lorries). You
can’t drive with a Group 2 licence if you don’t have full hypo awareness or
you’ve had one severe hypo in the last year. If you have a severe hypo at any
time, you must stop driving and tell the DVLA.

## If you haven’t told the DVLA about your diabetes
This can happen if your healthcare team doesn’t tell you that your diabetes,
or the way it’s now being treated, affects driving.
If you’re not sure, check the DVLA Summary for a Group 1 Licence or the DVLA
Summary for a Group 2 Licence or go to the DVLA directly.
If you’ve carried on driving without telling them when you needed to, you’ve
broken the law. Your insurance could be invalid, you could be fined and if
you’ve had a collision you could be prosecuted. So if you’ve got any doubts at
all, ask your healthcare team or call our helpline to get advice straight

What happens next depends on why it was revoked.

### You had more than one severe hypo while awake in 12 months
It doesn’t matter if you weren’t at the wheel at the time, you’ll still have
your licence taken away and the DVLA will need to decide if it can be
reissued. The DVLA won’t start to look into this until three months have
### You had a severe hypo at the wheel
If you’ve had a severe hypo while driving, you’ll probably lose your licence
because the DVLA will say you don’t have good enough hypo awareness to drive
safely. You must let them know straight away.
If you have a collision or are seen to be driving badly and it’s spotted by
the police or they’re called out, then your licence will be revoked – if they
find you had very low blood sugar at the time.
To get your licence back, your healthcare team will need to support your
reapplication. The DVLA will need to be satisfied that it happened because of
something unusual and that it probably won’t happen again. They’ll need to
know that over a period of at least three months (it could be longer), you
didn’t have another one and that your blood sugar levels have been good.
## What if your blood sugar level drops after a collision?
This can happen—particularly if you’ve been in an incident and you had to wait
for the emergency services to arrive. So you didn’t have time (or weren’t
able) to treat the start of a hypo.
You could lose your licence unless you can prove that your blood sugar levels
weren’t low at the time it happened, so didn’t cause it.
It helps if you can show that your blood sugar readings weren’t dangerously
low before the incident. So although you don’t need to have a meter with a
memory to hold a normal driving licence, it can help here as it can prove that
you’d been testing at times relevant to driving —and that your blood sugar
levels were OK within 2 hours before the accident.
If an ambulance is called, the paramedics fill out a report giving the results
of any tests, like a blood glucose test. There’s also a section on what they
think of your level of consciousness. If you can answer questions normally,
they should note this down and it can be helpful to your case. Their report
also shows the time help was called and so how long you may have had to wait
for treatment following a shock. This all helps, so make sure and ask for a
copy of the ambulance report to show the DVLA.
If the police arrived first, you could ask them for a report that says what
time they were called and what was said between you. Again, this could help
prove to the DVLA that there was some time between the shock of the incident
and when you were able to treat your diabetes.
Call our Helpline if you want more advice on any of this.
## Driving larger vehicles with a Group 1 licence
Older, paper licences used to be issued with entitlements showing that the
driver could drive (or tow) some larger vehicles.
But if you’re now on a medically restricted licence, it won’t allow you to
drive the same types of vehicle that were on your old paper licence.
If you want to drive these larger vehicles, you’ll need to apply for a Group 2
The rules around this can seem complicated and can depend on when your licence
was issued. It’s best to get in touch with DVLA.
Again, the rules around this can seem complicated and it’s best to go direct
For example, it can depend on whether you’re being paid to drive the minibus
and it can depend on when your licence was first issued. Check with the DVLA.
If you’re in Northern Ireland, you apply for a taxi licence through the DVA.
The licence has similar rules as a Group 2 Licence.
In England, Scotland and Wales, you need a Group 1 licence to drive a car-
sized taxi but you’ll also need to apply to your local taxi licencing
authority. They will have stricter rules similar to those for a Group 2
It’s now up to the service (police, fire or ambulance) in your area. They have
their own rules about whether you can drive an emergency vehicle if you take
The DVLA’s statement on this says that their rules are the same as they are
for all drivers with Group 1 or 2 licences. But the service in your local area
can decide if it needs to be stricter. It’s down to them.
This means that for larger vehicles, like a fire engine, you’ll probably need
a Group 2 licence but it’s up to your employer to risk assess the role. Then
they need to risk assess you and decide if it’s safe for you to do the job.
So, in some areas of the country the local emergency services will have extra
rules for drivers of emergency vehicles treating their diabetes with insulin.
It’s to make sure they’re as safe as any other driver and to avoid
discriminating against people with diabetes who can meet the standard.
