>>>>>>> #### Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2018, at age 50.
>>>>>>>> Some things are out of our control and we can’t do anything about
them. But the things we can control, we should. Like keeping physically
>>>>>>> Darren, engineer come stand-up comedian, lives with type 2 diabetes
and arthritis. He takes immune suppressant pills for his arthritis, and so has
been shielding during the coronavirus pandemic. Darren has created his own
mini gym in his garden to keep active while shielding.
>>>>>>> I was diagnosed with diabetes about two years ago, through a routine
check-up. I went to the doctors because I always felt tired. I was also
diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis about five years earlier, and I need to
keep moving to ease the arthritis. So keeping active benefits both of my
>>>>>>> When I was first told “you’re diabetic” I thought, “what does that
mean?” I didn’t know much about it, and I didn’t see it as a death sentence.
The doctor gave me a list of ‘do’s and don’ts’ for food and exercise. To eat
more fruit and vegetables, and exercise more. To be honest, I do feel I should
learn more about diabetes. At the moment I also take metformin to manage my
>>>>>>> I’ve got a supportive family around me, my four sons and daughter, my
fiancée Denise and my dog Molly. Denise and I had to postpone our wedding due
to Covid, which was tough. On top of that, we’ve both not been able to work.
Denise worries about me, wants to protect me. I’m worried too sometimes, but I
>>>>>>> Before Covid, I’d recently got into stand-up comedy. My eldest son was
the reason I started, as he also performs stand-up comedy. I told him that I
think I’m funnier than him, to which he replied, ‘’prove it!’’ So, I did
(although he will still insist he is funnier).
>>>>>>> I’ve been shielding from the start of the pandemic because I take
immune suppressant pills for my arthritis. The first two weeks were spent
watching TV and worrying about money! I have now returned to work but during
lockdown I was put in furloughed, due to lack of orders at work. Being an
engineer and normally on my feet all day at work – I really missed being busy.
I was also the chief dog walker before the pandemic struck, but I’ve had to
>>>>>>> When the mortgage holiday came though, it helped us a lot mentally.
It’s been a really stressful time, as it has for many others.
>>>>>>> Some things are out of our control and we can’t do anything about
them. But the things we can control, we should. Like keeping physically
>>>>>>> I realised that I needed to find a way to keep busy and active, so I
started by building a gym at the bottom of the garden. My son and I egg each
other on while working out together. We have an exercise bike, a rowing
machine and some weights. I’ve also joined a walking football group and take
part in a keepy-uppy competition of 1000 a week. Having a goal and challenging
>>>>>>> I’ve only recently started leaving the house, taking our dog Molly out
again, as well as the occasional trip to the shops.
>>>>>>> My advice for others trying to get active at the moment is to first
get in the right frame of mind mentally. Try not to see exercise, in any shape
of form, as a chore. Cleaning the windows is active, hoovering is stretching,
and so is painting the house. Even getting up and down when weeding is good
exercise. When I’m on the exercise bike, I watch TV and don’t even realise I’m
exercising. I plod along at a steady pace and my knees aren’t great, but I
>>>>>>> And exercising with someone else is much more fun than doing it alone,
if you can – especially with lots of options online at the moment. I never
thought I would consider doing a live Pilates class on Zoom (I am far too
‘tough’ for that), but surprisingly, I enjoyed it. Just don’t tell my mates
>>>>>>> I’ve been part of the We are Undefeatable campaign, with Diabetes UK
and lots of other charities. The filming was both fun and cathartic – I didn’t
think I’d open up, but I did. I was able to balance some of the more serious

Undefeatable campaign, so I haven’t had the chance to do any fundraising yet –
