When you live with diabetes looking after your blood glucose levels can become
your main health focus. However, many people forget that having diabetes can
increase your chance of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD generally
refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can
lead to a heart attack, stoke or chest pain.
Did you know when you are living with diabetes you be up to four times more
likely to have a heart attack or stroke? This is because diabetes can change
the chemical makeup of your blood, which may increase the development of
atherosclerosis, which is the build-up of plaque (made up of cholesterol and
other fats) in the arteries, causing blood vessels to narrow or to clog up
Your brain is fed by blood carrying oxygen and nutrients through blood vessels
called arteries, when blood cannot get to your brain, due to a block or burst
 _There are two main types of stroke, both stop blood from getting to areas of
This can occur when either an artery in the brain gets blocked by a clot that
might be formed somewhere in the body (usually the heart). The clot then
travels through the bloodstream to your brain. Or it may be due to the
formation of plaque which can affect the major arteries in the neck which
This occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is ruptured, stopping the
delivery of oxygen and nutrients. This is often be caused by high blood
## How do you know if someone is having a stroke?
The Stroke Foundation recommends the F.A.S.T. test as an easy way to remember
the most common signs of stroke, by asking these simple questions:
 **Face:** Check their face. Has their mouth dropped?
 **Speech:** Is their speech slurred? Do they understand you?
 **Time:** if you see any of these signs call 000 straight away.
While arm weakness, facial weakness and difficulty with speech are the most
common symptoms or signs of stroke, they are however not the only signs.
### Other signs of stroke can also occur alone or in combination:
* Dizziness, loss of balance or an unexplained fall
* Loss of vision, sudden blurring or decreased vision in one or both eyes
* Headache, usually severe and abrupt in onset
* Weakness or numbness or paralysis of the face, arm or leg on either side of the body.
Sometimes the signs disappear within a short time, such as a few minutes. This
may be a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), which occurs when the blood supply
to your brain is blocked temporarily. After a TIA, your risk of a stroke is
higher and a warning that you may have a stroke.
Remember, if you or others experiences the signs of stroke, **no matter how
When living with diabetes, you are more likely to have other health problems
that can cause heart disease, such as high cholesterol and high blood
pressure. This, along with having higher than ideal blood glucose levels, can
damage the blood vessels, making them more likely to develop fat deposits. So
looking after your heart health becomes extra important.
Regular physical activity can lower blood pressure and help reduce the risk of
a heart attack. Aim to do at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity.
Check with your doctor before starting exercise if you aren’t currently
Follow a healthy diet with a wide variety of foods, such as fruits,
vegetables, wholegrains, lean meat and low-fat dairy. It is also important to
limit foods high in saturated fat and salt to reduce your risk of heart
 **Keeping your blood fats (cholesterol and triglycerides) in check**
Have regular blood test to ensure your cholesterol, triglycerides levels are
High blood pressure is common in people with diabetes, weight loss (if needed)
and regular physical activity along with dietary changes such as reducing your
salt intake, replacing unhealthy fats (saturated fats & trans fats) with
healthy fats (unsaturated fats) and limit your alcohol intake can help reduce
Carrying excess weight, especially around your waist not only increases
insulin resistance but is a major risk factor for heart disease. Losing as
little as 5-10% of your weight can reduce your risk of stroke.
Smoking affects the vessels that supply blood to your heart and other parts of
your body, it not only increases stiffness of those blood vessels making it
harder to expand and contract, it also contributes to atherosclerosis, where
it can narrow and clog your arteries. Smoking can increase your risk of having
