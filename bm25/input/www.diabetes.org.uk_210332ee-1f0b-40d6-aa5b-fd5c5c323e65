Coeliac disease is a lifelong condition where your immune system reacts to
gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. This immune reaction damages
the lining of your gut, making it hard to absorb nutrients from food properly.
Coeliac disease is more common in people with Type 1 diabetes because both are
autoimmune conditions. Up to 10 per cent of people with coeliac disease also
If you have Type 2 diabetes you’re not at increased risk of coeliac disease as
However, there are many people who have coeliac disease, but don’t know it.
Here, we answer all your questions about the symptoms, treatment and
They range from mild to severe and include:
* unexpected weight loss (but not in all cases)
Coeliac disease is not the same as having a food allergy or being sensitive to
particular foods. The only treatment, once you have been diagnosed, is to cut
gluten out of your diet completely for the rest of your life.
## How can I tell if a food contains gluten?
New UK food labelling laws make it easier to choose gluten-free foods. By law,
manufacturers must list the ingredients containing gluten in bold. These
include wheat (including spelt, Kamut and seitan), triticale, barley and oats.
Common foods and drinks that aren’t suitable for people with coeliac disease
* barley (including products that contain malted barley, such as malted drinks, beers, ales, lagers and stouts)
Some people with coeliac disease are also sensitive to oats. This is because
oats contain avenin, a protein that’s similar to gluten. However, most people
with coeliac disease tolerate oats, although when a person is first diagnosed
with the condition, they will be advised by their doctor to avoid oats for the
first six months to allow their symptoms to improve.
Even tiny amounts of gluten may cause people with coeliac disease to have
symptoms in the short term and gut damage in the longer term. For this reason,
it’s important that people with coeliac disease make sure that any gluten-free
food they are preparing or eating doesn’t become contaminated with gluten.
Although oats are safe to eat for most people with coeliac disease, it’s
important that they aren’t produced in the same factory as wheat, barley and
rye, as they can become contaminated with gluten by these grains. Only oats
which are uncontaminated can be eaten by people with coeliac disease, who
However, there are a small number of people with coeliac disease who may still

* Processed foods labelled as having no gluten included.
These include vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, cheese, milk, eggs, potatoes,
quinoa cassava, rice, and buckwheat and pulses (peas, beans and lentils).
It’s really important to check that processed foods are gluten-free as it may
not be obvious they contain gluten. For example, flours used in a product made
from pulses, such as gram and urad flour, may be contaminated if they’re
produced in the same factory as wheat, barley and rye even though they’re
Most supermarkets and health food shops now stock gluten-free ranges,
including gluten-free bread made from rice or potato starch flour. Gluten-free
ranges are sometimes stocked on ‘free from’ aisles or stocked alongside foods
containing gluten so be very clear what you are buying.
Don’t forget to look online, too. It can help you to save time and see the
ranges available in store and by mail order.

prescription includes gluten-free bread, flour and pasta. Cakes and luxury-

following a gluten-free diet by letting what you’re preparing become
Coeliac UK, a charity that gives help and advice to people living with coeliac
disease, suggests these simple steps to help you keep the gluten-free food
* clean all pots and pans with washing-up liquid and water or use the dishwasher (very few washing-up liquids contain gluten, but if they do, standard rinsing will remove any traces)
* you don’t need to use separate cloths or sponges
* you may want to get separate bread boards to keep gluten-free and gluten-containing breads separate
* use a separate toaster or toaster bags
* use clean oil or a separate fryer for frying gluten-free foods
* use different knives and spoons to prevent breadcrumbs from getting into butter, jam and other condiments.

You may need to keep a closer eye on your blood glucose levels and it’s
important to liaise with your diabetes healthcare team as your diabetes
