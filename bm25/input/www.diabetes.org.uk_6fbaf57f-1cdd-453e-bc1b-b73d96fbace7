A low-calorie soup made with rice for a complete meal, or ideal as a winter
Please view Whisk.com privacy policy for more information
2 tbsp cream or 4 tbsp full-fat milk
1. Heat the oil in a medium frying pan.
2. Add the onion, garlic and carrot and fry for 3–4 minutes until beginning to soften.
3. Stir in the rice, spinach and stock, bring to the boil and simmer gently for 35 minutes until the rice is tender. Transfer to a blender or food processor with the cream or milk and plenty of black pepper, blitz until smooth then return to the pan to reheat.
* If using frozen spinach in place of fresh, you’ll only need 100g.
* If you don't use the soup straight away, you may need to add extra stock or water when you reheat as it will thicken after a while.
* Freezing instructions: Freeze in portions then defrost in the microwave. Heat until piping-hot, stirring regularly. Eat immediately and discard any leftovers.
