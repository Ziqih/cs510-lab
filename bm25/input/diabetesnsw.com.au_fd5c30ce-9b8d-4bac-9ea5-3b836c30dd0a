As most of us take a sigh of relief as we come to the end of the year, we hope
that it is time for you to rest and reinvigorate over the holiday period. This
can be a good time to reflect on what was good and what we could do
Do you need to take a reset on healthy habits, celebrate your journey so far,
If the holiday period is busy and stressful for you normally, what can you do
to reduce that stress this year? Could you do shopping earlier, prepare food
in advance or ask others to share the load? Do you really have to make things
complicated? Many of us are happy just to spend time together. Having things
be perfect really isn’t necessary and can be an added burden. Summer is a
great time for salads and barbeques rather than complex meals. Maybe spending
time with people you care about or going for a swim is a better way to use
your time. If you can’t spend the holiday with family because they are
interstate or overseas, can you celebrate with them in other ways such as a

There are often many things that we feel we have to do because others ask it
of us, or we feel that it is expected. If it causes too much stress or is too

good for both our physical and mental health. Social engagements enjoyed
outside could be an even more rewarding experience.
Despite 2020 being a stressful year with devastating bushfires affecting vast
parts of Australia, there was of course also the Covid pandemic. The pandemic
was frightening in its threat to our health and to the health of our loved
ones. It separated families and made people feel isolated and lonely. It was
unprecedented in our lifetime. Yet, here we are. We made it!
## What did you discover about yourself this year?
Perhaps you pleasantly surprised yourself with just how resilient you are. Do
you have more strength than you realise? Did you find creative solutions to
problems? Adversity has a way of showing us that we have inner resources that
If there were stressors or losses, acknowledge them and allow yourself to feel
sad or to grieve. Allow yourself time and acknowledge the importance of self-
care. What do you do to rebuild and feel re-energised? It is different for
everyone. Some people like to have time out to do creative or solitary
activities, others feel invigorated by being with others. Whatever it is for
you, be sure to prioritise that into your day. Maybe 15 minutes alone will be
You may benefit from the support of others so reach out to friends or family.
If you feel that you are persistently sad, stressed or anxious, have
difficulty sleeping or hopeless and overwhelmed you may benefit from
professional support. Speak with your doctor or your health professional.
There is also counselling or online support available if you need it. Our
concerns are often helped by the sharing with and support of others. You never
