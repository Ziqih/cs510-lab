# Exercise improves heart function for type 2
UK researchers have found that heart function can be significantly improved in
people with type 2 diabetes through exercise. The study, funded by the
National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) also showed that a low-energy
diet did not alter heart function in the group.
Dr. Gaurav Gulsin, a lead author of the study, said: “Heart failure is one of
the most common complications in people with type 2 diabetes.
Younger adults with type 2 diabetes already have changes in their heart
structure and function that put them at risk of developing heart failure later
Using the latest scanning techniques, we wanted to explore whether it is
possible to reverse these changes in this group through exercise and/or weight
Eighty-seven patients between 18 and 65 years of age, with type 2 diabetes
were broken into three 12 week programs - routine care, supervised aerobic
Thirty six healthy volunteers were enrolled as a control group.
The study found that patients who followed the supervised exercise program had
significantly improved heart function compared with the control group, and had
While the low energy diet did not improve heart function, it did have
favourable effects on the structure of the heart, vascular function and led to
the reversal of diabetes in 83 per cent of those in this group.
Gerry McCann, a senior author on the study said, “This research shows that
lifestyle changes like regular exercise training are important to limiting and
even reversing the damage to heart structure and function seen in younger
“It may seem obvious, but if we can empower people with type 2 diabetes to
make changes to their daily routines through exercise and healthy eating, we
may help them reduce the risk of heart failure and even early death.
Using imaging techniques such as MRI we can actually show them the benefits
their changes are making to their hearts”, said Dr McCann.
The research team recognize the study population was relatively small. But
believe the positive results add to our understanding of type 2 diabetes and
