>> # Type 1 Events in Northern Ireland
>> ## Better events on their way – share your feedback
>> We have enjoyed many years of successful Northern Ireland Type 1 Events and
every year we collect amazing feedback from those who attended and
volunteered. This feedback has been really helpful in letting us know what we
are good at and highlighting the things that we could do better. Diabetes UK
has decided to pause Type 1 Events so that we can use this time to focus and
re-evaluate the Type 1 Events and come back even better than before.
>> We will be joining colleagues from across the UK to share our best
practices and ensure that feedback becomes a reality across the whole of the
UK. We are really excited about some ideas that have already been shared and
we would like to hear from you if you have any thoughts or ideas.
>> We know that this news might be disappointing in the short term but we know
that taking this time, we will be able to provide the best possible Type 1
Events and we hope that you will be part of them.
