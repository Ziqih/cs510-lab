keeping active. It doesn’t matter whether it’s something small or new, or just
that little bit more of something you already do — all physical activity is

>>>>>>> A year after my surgery, as I was getting my strength back, my sister-
in-law, Cheryl, saw Swim22 advertised on Facebook. I needed to start being
more active, and swimming seemed like a good option. It’s the one sport that I
actually enjoy doing. I was still in and out of the hospital, adjusting to my
medication, so I signed up for 11 miles with Cheryl doing the other half.
>>>>>>> When I started training, I struggled to swim 12 lengths in an hour.
There were times I felt like swimming through treacle. But within three
months, I was doing 50 lengths in an hour.
>>>>>>> My family kept me going. We got into a little routine where three
generations would swim together on a Sunday morning. It was a great way of

swum four miles when Covid hit. As a transplant recipient, I had to shield. My
consultant still isn’t keen on me going back to the pool, but next year I’m

upheaval of this year, I’m in the best place I’ve been for a long time.

>>>>>>> I was told that the cold might have an effect on my blood sugar, but I
didn’t particularly notice that. When I was doing my Arctic training, I was
using a blood glucose monitor and it was affected by the cold. Then you have
to expose your hands to do the prick You could only do that in the tent as
it’s too cold outside. So, the hardest thing was that I could only test in the
morning and in the evening. In the meantime, I just had to rely on how I felt.
I’m quite lucky in that my body will tell me when I’m going low. That, and
stopping my insulin from too cold, was tricky.
>>>>>>> Diabetes makes you more prone to having circulation problems, but I’m
fortunate that I haven’t experienced that. I have had frost nip from exposure
in the mountains. Only mild, but once you’ve had that you’re more susceptible
to it again. So, you have to spend some time rewarming if your hands get too
cold. It’s one of those things. You haven’t got a great deal of other things
to do, other than skiing and sleep, so stopping to warm your hands up from
time to time is no biggie, but you’ve got to do it. Otherwise the cold will
>>>>>>> When I went to the South Pole, I used a FreeStyle Libre. I wanted to
know what my blood sugars were doing every hour or whenever I stopped for a
break. As it happened, it was a fantastic piece of kit. Portsmouth University
has a cold weather chamber which I got to use with all my kit on, using the
monitor, and knew it was going to work.
>>>>>>> When I was 12 years old, my mum had a keep fit class at our local
sports ground and I went along with her. I was bored, so I joined in with some
people at running track. That was the start of my long love affair with track
>>>>>>> I was very fast, always the best at school, always would beat the
boys, and I recognised then that I had a big ability and a big talent. When my
school recognised I had an ability, I was encouraged a lot, particularly by
>>>>>>> I loved it. I loved the training vibe, the fact that there were
different communities, diversities. It didn’t matter what your background was.
All that was important was being at the track with people around you with a
>>>>>>> My greatest achievement was walking out, wearing my team GB tracksuit,
into the 1996 Olympic Games. I also represented Great Britain in the 1998
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur and in the 2006 Commonwealth Games in
>>>>>>> I was the first woman to jump over 14m in the Commonwealth. That was a
big achievement. Breaking milestones made me want to encourage and inspire
others that they could also do great things.
>>>>>>> When you compete at that level, it takes over everything. But I am
such a big advocate of sport because of the benefits. They are huge. Sport has
equipped me with so many life skills. You learn emotional intelligence, you
know when you have to work hard. I use sport as a vehicle, to allow me to
branch out to different things. It’s afforded me so much.
>>>>>>> I don’t care if my three children don’t do sport to a competitive
level. But what I would like to see is that everyone is able to participate in
sport – at any level. It’s down to schools to encourage that, because you
don’t know what hidden talents are out there.
>>>>>>> After I retired, I did take my foot off the gas in terms of training.
I started living a much more relaxed life. I set different goals for myself.
So, I did some half marathons, kickboxing, weight training. I’ve always loved

them. But the things we can control, we should. Like keeping physically
>>>>>>> I realised that I needed to find a way to keep busy and active, so I
started by building a gym at the bottom of the garden. My son and I egg each
other on while working out together. We have an exercise bike, a rowing
machine and some weights. I’ve also joined a walking football group and take
part in a keepy-uppy competition of 1000 a week. Having a goal and challenging
>>>>>>> I’ve only recently started leaving the house, taking our dog Molly out
again, as well as the occasional trip to the shops.
>>>>>>> My advice for others trying to get active at the moment is to first
get in the right frame of mind mentally. Try not to see exercise, in any shape
of form, as a chore. Cleaning the windows is active, hoovering is stretching,
and so is painting the house. Even getting up and down when weeding is good
exercise. When I’m on the exercise bike, I watch TV and don’t even realise I’m
exercising. I plod along at a steady pace and my knees aren’t great, but I
>>>>>>> And exercising with someone else is much more fun than doing it alone,
if you can – especially with lots of options online at the moment. I never
thought I would consider doing a live Pilates class on Zoom (I am far too
‘tough’ for that), but surprisingly, I enjoyed it. Just don’t tell my mates
>>>>>>> I got back from Newcastle on the Monday and decided I needed to get
started. I went to see the diabetes nurse who talked about control with diet
and exercise only, but there wasn’t a lot of in-depth information. I’ve never
had diabetes medication prescribed. Looking back, I don’t think people are
made aware of just how much they can do themselves. I never got a huge sense
that I could change much or put myself into remission. I was also put on blood
>>>>>>> I went on the DESMOND course but didn’t learn a great deal, as I’d
done a lot of the research myself. In fact, the research frightened the life
out of me. The thought of losing my eyesight was the key motivator. I thought
to myself, if there’s anything I can do about this then I’ll do whatever it
>>>>>>> I started out simply by walking. I used to be pretty fit when I was
younger and would go to the gym four times a week. But now I wanted to take up
exercise that was realistic and I could incorporate into my day.
>>>>>>> I knew that my diet needed to change drastically, too. A typical meal
before my diagnosis was lots of carbs – always big portions of bread and
potatoes. So I changed to a low-carb, high-fat and low in saturates diet, and
cut out sweet stuff altogether. I also loved salt, which is why my blood
pressure had always been high, but I haven’t touched a salt cellar since my
diagnosis. Diabetes UK’s website and the Carbs & Cals book and app really
>>>>>>> I’m a bit of a gasbag and would often be on the phone for hours at a
time. So I started putting in my headphones and walking while I was on the
phone. Or if I was at home spending time on my computer, I would take breaks
and get on the crosstrainer or the rowing machine I’d bought – even if it was
