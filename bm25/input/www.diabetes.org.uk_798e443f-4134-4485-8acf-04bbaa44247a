Our Foyle Diabetes Support group were chosen for the award for their bravery
and dedication in supporting everyone living with diabetes.
This newly established group has achieved a great deal within a short period
of time. As Derry/Londonderry is a part of Northern Ireland split between
nationalist and loyalist groups, these volunteers decided to keep their
support politically neutral and try to reach both communities.
A strong and supportive committee of volunteers got the group off the ground
and have been building key relationships within the community, including a
valuable relationship with their local Healthy Living Centre in Londonderry.
Together, they aim to remain politically neutral by alternating meetings
between different locations; working tirelessly to reach out and connect with
all people living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in their local area.
They have also put together excellent programme of activities, fundraising
events and will be organising the Derry bridges walk later this year. With
their committed members they are thriving and continuing to grow; promising an
exciting future for the group and for people living with diabetes in their

Jayden’s younger sister Ava, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2015. From
the moment Ava was diagnosed, Jayden wanted to help with the care needed to
make sure she was okay. At the age of 6, there was only so much he could do to
help which is why his mum Adele suggested fundraising.

hosting a pyjama day at home and throwing a picnic in the park raising a
staggering £1710 for Diabetes UK. Jayden’s hard work was rewarded when he won
