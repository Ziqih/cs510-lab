# Help improve delivery of diabetes care in Australia
 **Help ensure people diagnosed with diabetes receive the best possible
Kate Gudorf, a Diabetes Educator and Dietitian, is leading the Australian T2
Remission Project – replicating a world-first study conducted in the UK that
has proven it is possible to put type 2 diabetes into remission.
The diabetes remission clinical study (DiRECT) was conducted in the United
Kingdom. Results from DiRECT UK demonstrated that nearly half (46%) of people
with type 2 diabetes, diagnosed for less than 6 years, could achieve remission
at 12 months through following a structured weight management program.
Proving that the program works in the Australian context is what health
authorities require before they can implement it in general practices across
the country. To deliver this research study, we’re working with scientists
from the University of Sydney and primary health networks.
 **If the Australian T2 Remission Project is successful, it has the potential
to transform our health system – and the treatment and experience of type 2
You have an opportunity today to support research that improves the way that
people are treated when they’re diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Someone may
even put their diabetes into remission with your help.
 **Please donate now to ensure Australians diagnosed with type 2 diabetes can
receive the best possible medical care and support. Your donation today will
tackle isolation, advocate and care for people living with diabetes – as well
as aid in the search for better treatments.**
