>>>>>>> I was 59 when I was told I had Type 2 diabetes. It came at a difficult
time – just months after I’d had a heart attack in 2011.
>>>>>>> For the next three years, I was on ever-increasing medication for my
diabetes, so when my GP mentioned the DiRECT trial, I jumped at the chance. At
95kg (15 stone) and feeling more ill every day, I was desperate to improve my
>>>>>>> The diet was very difficult – I can’t say otherwise. Having just
liquid rather than actual food for such a long time (17 weeks in total) is
odd. And as part of the trial I had to come off all my medication, which was
initially a little daunting. But I was absolutely determined.
>>>>>>> I made a lot of sacrifices. My husband did all the cooking and food
shopping. My husband and any guests would eat in the dining area and I ate
separately in the living room. It was also around the time my first grandchild
was born, but I still stuck to it.
>>>>>>> Having a liquid diet made it easier in some ways, as I didn’t have to
think about food. I also had great support from all my family and friends.
>>>>>>> After four months on the liquid diet, I was able to gradually
introduce food into my diet with the help of my GP and diabetes nurse. I was
regularly weighed and my blood glucose levels (HbA1c) were checked. I also
started keeping a food diary, and kept active by going to the gym and walking
>>>>>>> ### One of the lucky ones in remission
>>>>>>> Around the time I started re-introducing food into my diet, I was told
that my Type 2 diabetes had gone into remission. I’d lost 16kg (2.6 stone) and
was now down to 79kg (12.4 stone). When doctors told me that my pancreas was
working again, it felt fantastic, absolutely amazing! I don’t think of myself
as a diabetic anymore. I get all my diabetes checks done, but I don’t feel
like a diabetic. I am one of the lucky ones to have gone into remission.
>>>>>>> By the end of the first year, I was down to 71kg (11.3 stone) and at
the end of the two-year trial, I weighed 72.5kg (11.4 stone).
>>>>>>> I’ve been eating normally now for a year since the trial finished and
my Type 2 diabetes is still in remission. My weight has now stabilised – and
>>>>>>> I’ve not taken any medication for diabetes in three years, I can’t
believe I am back to normal weight, exercising every day and feeling great!
>>>>>>> Isobel Murray, 65, from Largs in North Ayreshire was the first person
in Scotland to go on the trial. People are taking part in DiRECT for two
years, but everyone was recruited at different times. This means some people
are still on the trial, and some have finished. Everyone has completed one
year, which is why the researchers can announce those results. Isobel has now
finished the trial and can share her story.
