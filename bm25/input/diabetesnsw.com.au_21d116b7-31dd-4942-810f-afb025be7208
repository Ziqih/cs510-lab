As Patron, I am delighted to convey my personal best wishes to all Members and
This is a difficult time for everyone, as we each seek to manage the social,
financial and emotional impact of the COVID-19 measures that are currently in
place. For people living with diabetes, this is a more trying time than usual.
Managing the daily routine of diabetes, observing your health advice and
focusing on your well-being is thus especially important at this time of
increased anxiety. With some brighter news of late, we may take some comfort
knowing that the number of new cases diagnosed each day is decreasing.
It is also heart-warming to know that family, friends and members of the wider
community are thinking of you, concerned for your health and general
wellbeing. I spoke at length with Sturt Eastwood, the Chief Executive Officer
of Diabetes NSW & ACT, recently and I am very proud of how his team has
adapted to the changing environment. Restrictions on bringing people together
has meant so many education events have had to be cancelled. However, his team
is working hard to ensure they can continue to support you with your diabetes
self-management needs, albeit in new and different ways.
Despite the challenges we are experiencing, I am confident we will soon be
able to look back on this period as a time when we, as a community, came
together to protect lives and to look out for the health and well-being of
Her excellency The Honourable Margaret Beazley AC QC
