# Possible vaccine for virus linked to type 1 diabetes
Many medical researchers believe certain virus infections play a part in the
autoimmune attack that leads to type 1 diabetes.
Researchers in Sweden and Finland have recently cracked the code and produced
a possible vaccine for these viruses in the hope that it could provide
While cases of type 1 diabetes increase worldwide the causes of the condition
remain unknown. Researchers believe there is a genetic component, but that
One such factor believed to be significant in type 1 diabetes is infections
caused by a very common group of enteroviruses. The sub-group in question is
the Coxsackie B (CVB) family and it comprises of six strains that can give
rise to the common cold. However, CVBs can also cause more serious infections
According to scientific observations, CVBs play a part in the development of
Type 1 diabetes is characterised by an autoimmune attack on the insulin-
producing beta cells in the pancreas and it is possible that the virus
infection somehow initiates this attack by the immune system.
Epidemiological studies, in which children with a genetic risk profile for
type 1 diabetes were monitored by blood tests over a period of many years,
indicate that CVBs could be a pathogenic contributor.
There are also autopsy observations suggesting that CVBs might be involved in
the development of type 1 diabetes. This, however, remains hypothetical as the
connection is yet to be proven, albeit it is a hypothesis that is well-
Researchers at Karolinska Institutet and their colleagues at Tampere
University and University of Jyväskylä in Finland have now produced a vaccine
that protects against all six known strains of CVB. The vaccine was tested in
different animal models and was shown to protect mice infected with CVB from
The researchers then tested the vaccine in rhesus monkeys that have very
similar genetics to humans. In these animals, the vaccine worked well and
induced antibodies to CVB suggesting it could protect against the virus.
“The results give important scientific support to an ongoing clinical
development program aiming at testing a similar commercial vaccine in humans,”
says Professor Heikki Hyöty from Tampere University who participates in the
Assuming the vaccine is safe in initial clinical trials, the plan is to use
the vaccine in children with a genetic risk profile for type 1 diabetes. The
researchers believe that if the number of children that develop type 1
diabetes decreases after vaccination or if none develop the disease it will
confirm that CVBs are a triggering environmental factor.
“Our hope is that these trials will show that this kind of vaccine is
effective against CVB infections and can be administered to children,” says
Malin Flodström-Tullberg, professor of type 1 diabetes at the Department of
“It would be fantastic if we could prevent the cases of type 1 diabetes that
we currently suspect are caused by Coxsackievirus, although the exact number
is difficult to estimate. At the same time, the vaccine would give protection
against myocarditis, which can have a severe course in both children and
adults, and against some types of colds, which regularly keep many away from
The study was published in the scientific journal Science Advances.
