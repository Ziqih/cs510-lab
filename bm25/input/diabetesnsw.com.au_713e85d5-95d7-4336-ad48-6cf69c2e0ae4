The triage nurse took one look at Molly, pricked her finger, then went ‘bang’
on a buzzer. _“It just went crazy from there; it was a blur, a whirlwind,”_
Unfortunately, the medical emergency and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was just
the beginning. Diabetes management is relentless and painful, and on top of
the physical discomfort, Molly experienced a deeper hurt. She started being
left out socially – excluded because of her diabetes.
 _“Her invitations to sleepovers stopped, her invitations to birthday parties,
to playdates,”_ says Kirsty. _“So at the time she needed her friends most, her
support network was taken away. Purely out of other parents thinking ‘oh no,
she’s got diabetes, we don’t want to make her sick’.”_
So the family jumped at the chance to attend their first Diabetes NSW & ACT
DiaBuddies Days last Christmas and this March. DiaBuddies Days are not only
great fun. They let kids with type 1, siblings and parents connect with others
 _“Kids can pull their pump out and prick their finger and no-one asks
questions or stares at them,”_ says Kirsty. _“They can feel comfortable for
the day. And as parents, it’s just so good. The carbohydrates are written down
on the food, and it’s such a caring environment. You can almost switch off.”_
On her own, Molly also attended one of our three-day camps. Being sporty and
adventurous, Molly loved the outdoor activities on offer. Best of all, though,
 _“Lo and behold, the first person we spoke to when we got there just so
happened to live a five minute drive from us,”_ says Kirsty. _“And they had a
girl who’s two years older but the age difference doesn’t matter.. She had
been through a bad experience as well, with losing friends and everything
 _“The two hit it off. They’re little besties. They facetime on their iPhones
or they message or they call or have playdates. It is so great, and for that
we are indebted to people who support Diabetes NSW and ACT.”_
