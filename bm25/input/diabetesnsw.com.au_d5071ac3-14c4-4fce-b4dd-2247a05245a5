The Christmas holidays can be a stressful time of year, trying to squeeze
parties, cooking and last minute shopping into an already full calendar!
During the silly season it’s especially important to be mindful of your stress
levels as they can impact your blood glucose levels. Here are a few tips to
help you de-stress during the busiest time of year.
It’s true that the early bird gets the worm! Start out December with a plan of
how you’re going to achieve what you need by the 25th – whether you prefer to-
do lists or deadlines, it will keep you organised and your stress levels down.
Another way to get on top of the growing pile of jobs is to grab a calendar
and start allocating time for getting gifts, food shopping and upcoming
events. Planning what you need to get done now will take the pressure off and
help you avoid last-minute scrambles when you should be enjoying the end of
Crowded shopping centres can be stressful and they’re certainly no one’s idea
of a good time. When you do go to the shops, try to go early to beat the
crowds (and to get that coveted parking space in the shade). Take a list of
what you need and work through it logically – it’ll save you a second, or even
Spending your time relaxing in the lead up to Christmas sounds counter-
intuitive, but running around constantly is only going to increase your stress
levels, even if you’re having fun. It doesn’t have to be a long spa session –
taking half an hour to read a book or go for a walk every day can be enough.
We can get caught up in finding the perfect present or having a four course
meal to present to the family, but remember that Christmas is about being with
the people you love. The holidays are a time of celebration and it’s alright
if things don’t go according to plan. Even if your back-up plan is less than
ideal, you can still crack open a Christmas cracker and enjoy the day.
Stress can impact your BGLs, along with warm weather, food, sugary drinks and
alcohol – all of which are in abundance around Christmas. No one wants their
results to be outside their target range and the results can cause stress, but
remember that regular testing is just a way of getting the information you
need to adjust your management accordingly. If you’re worried about managing
your blood glucose levels over Christmas, speak to your diabetes healthcare
team and come up with a strategy together. No one expects you to be perfect!
