Researchers at Stanford University are developing a new insulin formulation
that begins to take effect almost immediately upon injection. Potentially
working four times as fast as current commercial fast-acting insulin
In a new ultrafast-acting insulin formulation, researchers used a polymer to
stabilize a form of insulin that is quickly absorbed in the bloodstream.
Without the polymer, this insulin is too unstable for practical use.
The researchers focused on so-called monomeric insulin, which has a molecular
structure that, according to theory, should allow it to act faster than other
forms of insulin. The catch is that monomeric insulin is too unstable for
practical use. So, in order to realize the ultrafast potential of this
insulin, the researchers relied on some materials science magic.
“The insulin molecules themselves are fine, so we wanted to develop a ‘magic
fairy dust’ that you add into a vial that would help to fix the stability
problem,” said Eric Appel, assistant professor of materials science and
“People often focus on the therapeutic agents in a drug formulation but, by
focusing only on the performance additives – parts that were once referred to
as ‘inactive ingredients’ – we can achieve really big advancements in the
After screening and testing a large library of additive polymers, the
researchers found one that could stabilize monomeric insulin for more than 24
hours in stressed conditions. (By comparison, commercial fast-acting insulin
stays stable for six to ten hours under the same conditions.)
The researchers then confirmed the ultrafast action of their formulation in
pigs with diabetes. Their results were published July 1 in Science
Now, the researchers are conducting additional tests in hopes of qualifying
Current commercial formulations of insulin contain a mix of three forms:
monomers, dimers and hexamers. Scientists have assumed monomers would be the
most readily useful in the body but, within vials, the insulin molecules are
drawn to the surface of the liquid where they aggregate and become inactive.
(Hexamers are more stable in the vial but take longer to work in the body
because they first have to break down into monomers to become active.) This is
where the “magic fairy dust” – a custom polymer that is attracted to the
“We focused on polymers that would preferentially go to that interface and act
as a barrier between any of the insulin molecules trying to gather there,”
said Joseph Mann, a co-lead author of the paper. Crucially, the polymer can do
this without interacting with the insulin molecules themselves, allowing the
Finding just the right polymer with the desired properties was a long process
that involved a three-week trip to Australia, where a fast-moving robot
created approximately 1500 preliminary candidates. This was followed by
processing and testing individually by hand at Stanford to identify polymers
that successfully exhibited the desired barrier behaviour. The first 100
candidates didn’t stabilize commercial insulin in tests but the researchers
pressed on. They found their magic polymer only weeks before they were
scheduled to run experiments with pigs with diabetes.
“It felt like there was nothing happening and then all of the sudden there was
this bright moment … and a deadline a couple of months away,” said Mann. “The
moment we got an encouraging result, we had to hit the ground running.”
In commercial insulin – which typically remains stable for about 10 hours in
accelerated aging tests – the polymer drastically increased the duration of
stability for upwards of a month. The next step was to see how the polymer
affected monomeric insulin, which on its own aggregates in 1-2 hours. It was
another welcome victory when the researchers confirmed that their formulation
could remain stable for over 24 hours under stress.
“In terms of stability, we took a big step backward by making the insulin
monomeric. Then, by adding our polymer, we met more than double the stability
of the current commercial standard,” said Caitlin Maikawa, co-lead author of
With a seed grant from the Stanford Diabetes Research Centre and the Stanford
Maternal and Child Health Research Institute, the researchers were able to
evaluate their new monomeric insulin formulation in pigs with diabetes – the
most advanced non-human animal model – and found that their insulin reached 90
percent of its peak activity within five minutes after the insulin injection.
For comparison, the commercial fast-acting insulin began showing significant
activity only after 10 minutes. Furthermore, the monomeric insulin activity
peaked at about 10 minutes while the commercial insulin required 25 minutes.
In humans, this difference could translate to a four-fold decrease in the time
“When I ran the blood tests and started plotting the data, I almost couldn’t
“It’s really unprecedented,” said Appel, who is senior author of the paper.
“This has been a major target for many big pharmaceutical companies for
The monomeric insulin also finished its action sooner. Both beginning and
ending activity sooner makes it easier for people to use insulin in
coordination with mealtime glucose levels to appropriately manage their blood
The researchers plan to apply to the Food and Drug Administration for approval
to test their insulin formulation in clinical trials with human participants
(although no trials are planned yet and they are not seeking participants at
this time). They are also considering other uses for their polymer, given how
Because their insulin formulation activates so quickly – and, therefore, more
like insulin in a person without diabetes – the researchers are excited by the
possibility that it could aid the development of an artificial pancreas device
that functions without the need for patient intervention at mealtimes.
