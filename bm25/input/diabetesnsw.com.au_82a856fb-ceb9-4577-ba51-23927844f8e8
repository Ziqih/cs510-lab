# Does diabetes put you at risk of COVID-19?

anyone else. However, just as with the flu, living with diabetes puts you at
greater risk of experiencing more severe symptoms and developing
When it comes to living with diabetes and viral infections, like COVID-19, the
most important thing to remember is to **be prepared before you get sick**.
People living with diabetes should have a personalised sick day action plan
and a sick day management kit ready to use at the earliest sign of illness. If
you don’t have one already, your diabetes healthcare team can help you put

##**What are the risks for people living with diabetes?**
Being unwell can make it more difficult to manage your diabetes. This is
because your body releases stress hormones by when you are sick. These
hormones make your liver increase the amount of glucose in your bloodstream,
and make it difficult for your insulin to do its job. These hormones increase
This can cause your blood glucose levels to rise and therefore it is important
to monitor blood glucose levels more often when you are unwell.
If you are sick and have high blood glucose levels, you may be at risk of
severe dehydration. This can leave you feeling drowsy and confused, and result
in the need for urgent medical attention. Dehydration can affect the
interstitial cell fluid balance and hence, if you are using continuous glucose
monitoring it is a good idea to double check your blood glucose level with a
It’s very important to keep up your fluid and carbohydrate intake when you are
feeling unwell, to avoid dehydration and low blood glucose levels, known as
It is important that you continue a normal schedule of your medications. Be
aware that some **over-the-counter medications,** such as cough mixtures and
decongestants, contain sugar which can make your BGLs even higher.
If you are taking insulin, you may need _extra_ insulin when you are unwell,
even when you are not eating much, are vomiting or have diarrhoea. Your blood
glucose levels will determine if you need extra insulin. Your diabetes health
professional can give you advice on what changes you need to make to your
insulin dose or type of insulin when you are sick.
If you have type 1 diabetes you should also check for **ketones** if your
blood glucose levels rise above 15 or you have symptoms that may suggest you
have or are developing a condition called Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).
People who have type 2 diabetes and take an SGLT-2 inhibitor are also at
higher risk of developing DKA. SGLT-2 inhibitors include:
Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious condition that occurs when the levels
of glucose and ketones in the blood are too high. The build-up of ketones
makes the blood too acidic and leads to a loss of body salts and fluids. If
you have large amounts of ketones in your blood or urine, you may have DKA and
You can help prevent DKA by following your sick day action plan. This should
include information about managing your diabetes when you are unwell, which
you have discussed with your GP or diabetes healthcare team.
Let a friend or family member know that you are unwell. Tell them about your
sick day action plan in case you need any help. If required, have someone stay
Seek medical help to treat the illness. Contact your GP early to avoid
becoming even more unwell and needing emergency care.
You may also need to contact your diabetes healthcare team for advice about
adjusting your insulin dose or medications during periods of illness,
especially if your glucose levels stay above 15mmol/L or below 4mmol/L.
* Take care with personal hygiene to avoid the spread of germs.
* Keep your blood glucose levels within your target range to help reduce the risk of illness and infections
* Follow your sick day action plan and use your sick day kit
* If you are on insulin or self monitor check your BGLs more often
* Keep taking your insulin or diabetes medications
* Drink plenty of fluids and keep eating
* See your doctor or diabetes healthcare team
