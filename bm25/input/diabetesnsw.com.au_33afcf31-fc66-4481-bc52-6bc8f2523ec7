To put the urgency of good bone health into perspective, it’s estimated that
by 2022 there will be over 2 million older people with low bone mass in NSW &
ACT. With the prevalence of brittle bones so high in Australia, it’s essential
to understand how to keep your bones healthy and strong.
## Let's take a closer look at the role exercise plays
How does exercise increase bone density? Our bones respond in a very similar
fashion to our muscles in response to exercise – it helps improve their
strength! Bone is a type of tissue which responds to applied force making it
stronger, just like our muscles. As a result, regular exercise can help
strengthen and maintain your bone density, and reduce the risk of
complications such as osteoporosis that comes with aging.
Think of your bones as a scaffold, consisting of workers that help build bone
strength. As we get older, these workers become more tired and can’t keep
maintaining bone strength. By placing stress and impact through the bones, we
'wake' these workers up, increasing productivity and improving bone strength.
One of the best types of exercises to improve bone strength is resistance
exercise, or lifting weights. By adding resistance to movements, you increase
force through both your muscles and your bones, increasing strength in both
areas. Talk about bang for your buck! Some examples of resistance exercises
include Wall Push-Ups, Sit to Stands or Squats, or any other exercises that
involve producing force through the muscle and bone.
Other weight bearing exercises such as walking, dancing, or sports like tennis
can also improve bone health through impact. They can also stimulate bone
growth and development. However, if you been diagnosed bone frailty please
consult your GP or an Accredited Exercise Physiologist about what exercises
An area of exercise less commonly discussed around osteoporosis is balance and
mobility. As we age, our risk of falls increases due to declines in our
function. Brittle bones and falls' risk aren’t a great combination. Therefore,
by consistently completing balance and mobility exercises, you can reduce the
risk of falls and lower your risk of fractures. Some examples here could be
Yoga or Tai-Chi. These won’t directly improve bone strength, but by helping
improve your balance, mobility, and core strength, you’re less likely to fall
Exercise isn’t the only way to help maintain or improve bone strength. Vitamin
D, which we get from natural sunlight, is another important factor in bone
health. You may consider exercising outdoors to get the best of both worlds.
As I’m sure you have heard before, calcium is also an essential component for
healthy bones. A combination of vitamin D, calcium and exercise will help you
maintain bone strength and prevent long term injuries like fractures.
Keep your bones strong and help reduce the risk of osteoporosis or a fracture.
