>>>>>>>> Taking part in Swim22 helped my recovery so much. Despite all the
upheaval of this year, I’m in the best place I’ve been for a long time.
>>>>>>> Amanda was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was 18. She
hasn't always looked after herself as well as she could, but following a
kidney and pancreas transplant in 2018 she's been getting more active and
living a healthier lifestyle. After her sister-in-law spotted our Swim 22
challenge advertised on Facebook she realised it was perfect opportunity to
raise vital funds to support our work while enjoying her favourite type of
>>>>>>> I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2001, aged 18. I got all the
usual symptoms, the thirst, going to the loo a lot, and I lost a lot of
weight. I had a blood test and was at work later that day when I got a phone
call the same day saying I had to get to the hospital immediately.
>>>>>>> I was a bit numb. I don’t think I took in half of what I was being
told. They showed me how to do injections and I had to show them I could do
it, but it’s obviously a complete lifestyle change. I was 18, just finished
college, just started my first job in a travel agent, and I didn’t want to
watch what I was eating and drinking, inject insulin or test my blood sugar. I
>>>>>>> I didn’t deal with it, which is why I’m in the pickle that I’m in now.
>>>>>>> In my early 20s, I did the bare minimum that I had to do to make
>>>>>>> When I was 21, I got flu. I wasn’t taking enough insulin anyway, but
because I was ill, I probably needed even more, because you produce more
glucose when you’re ill as your body tries to fight the infection. I was
admitted to hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious problem that
can happen in people with diabetes when there is a severe lack of insulin in
the body. At the hospital, they said to Mum and Dad, ‘if she lasts the next
>>>>>>> During that hospital stay, it was suggested I speak to someone older
who had complications of type 1 diabetes. I think it was to shock me. But I
didn’t want to speak to anyone, I didn’t want to know. I was in complete
>>>>>>> After I was discharged I thought, ‘I’ll do it all properly now.’ but
that lasted for a couple of months. I hid the fact that I wasn’t doing my
injections. If my parents asked if I’d done them, and I’d lie and say I had.
>>>>>>> If there are any teenagers reading this who have type 1 and have the
same mindset that I had – I’m invincible, I don’t need to do injections or
check my blood sugar – I want to say, ‘you’re not!’
>>>>>>> I don’t want you to be in the same place that I am years down the
>>>>>>> But it’s also important to remind myself that it’s not my fault. I
should have been given more support at the time. Thankfully there is better
information and support for teens that are being diagnosed now.
>>>>>>> I hid the fact that I wasn’t doing my injections. If my parents asked
if I’d done them, and I’d lie and say I had.
>>>>>>> ###My health got worse and I developed complications
>>>>>>> At 28, I was working as a holiday rep in Spain where I noticed my
eyesight was getting worse. I was struggling to read the fine print of booking
>>>>>>> When I came home from Spain, I had my eyes tested. I was told that as
a result of my diabetes I’d developed cataracts in both eyes and retinopathy.
Three days before I was supposed to leave for a placement in Venice, I was
told I had to stay and have surgery to save my eyesight.
>>>>>>> I was angry at diabetes and at that point I was starting to feel it
was maybe my fault – I told myself if I’d looked after myself a bit more, I
>>>>>>> I had to give up my job and I had two operations on my eyes. Around
the same time, I also found out I had Charcot foot – a complication of
diabetes where nerve damage means that when you put pressure on your foot, the
bone and joints can start to change shape over time. I had to use a wheelchair
>>>>>>> Once my eyes were better, I started doing art lessons and when I was
told I could start walking again, I got a job in a travel agent and met my
>>>>>>> Six weeks later, a routine blood test at the diabetes clinic showed
that I had 21 per cent kidney function. It stunned me. At that point I wasn’t
showing symptoms. It was later that I started to feel tired and sick.
>>>>>>> In January 2017 I was put on dialysis. I felt awful at that point,
although I was still working full time. That was hard. I was trying to be all
happy, selling holidays, but I felt so rubbish.
>>>>>>> I was on dialysis for 14 months. At that point I blamed myself. But a
counsellor at the kidney clinic said that at the age I was diagnosed, you
don’t necessarily have the mindset to be able to deal with type 1 diabetes.
Yet you’re treated as an adult patient. She said it wasn’t my fault, that
there are special clinics now for teenagers like me who struggle with a type 1
>>>>>>> In March 2018, I had a kidney and pancreas transplant. It’s not very
common. The doctors said that as diabetes was the cause of my kidney failure,
it would make sense to have the pancreas as well.
>>>>>>> They gave me the choice of having just the kidney or both, but it felt
like a no-brainer, really. The waiting list for both organs together is a lot
shorter as there’s a lot less people on it. Because both organs would ideally
>>>>>>> I was called twice by the transplant team. The first time, when they
said, ‘we’ve found a match,’ I was a complete mess. They give you three hours
to get to the hospital. It was crazy. I had to take a couple of minutes,
>>>>>>> We got there, I had all the checks to make sure I was stable and it
was a definitive match. Then we had to wait overnight for the organs to
arrive. They have to make sure they’re suitable, but unfortunately the first
time the pancreas had been damaged along the way. That’s really disappointing.
>>>>>>> My second call came about a month later. I was at work when my phone
rang. I was a lot calmer that time, because I knew what to expect.
>>>>>>> At the hospital, as I was taken down to surgery I felt hopeful,
>>>>>>> My recovery afterwards was slow – I developed a bad infection – but my
new pancreas started working immediately. Since that day I haven’t needed any
insulin. I’m still classed as having diabetes, but I’m treated by transplant.
Today, I live life as though I don’t have diabetes.
>>>>>>> It took a while to get used to. Even now, occasionally, I think, ‘I
>>>>>>> I still have to be careful with what I eat and my overall health
because the medication that I have to take after my transplant can cause type
>>>>>>> A year after my surgery, as I was getting my strength back, my sister-
in-law, Cheryl, saw Swim22 advertised on Facebook. I needed to start being
more active, and swimming seemed like a good option. It’s the one sport that I
actually enjoy doing. I was still in and out of the hospital, adjusting to my
medication, so I signed up for 11 miles with Cheryl doing the other half.
>>>>>>> When I started training, I struggled to swim 12 lengths in an hour.
There were times I felt like swimming through treacle. But within three
months, I was doing 50 lengths in an hour.
>>>>>>> My family kept me going. We got into a little routine where three
generations would swim together on a Sunday morning. It was a great way of
>>>>>>> This year, we managed to rope in Mike and his mum to our team. I’d
swum four miles when Covid hit. As a transplant recipient, I had to shield. My
consultant still isn’t keen on me going back to the pool, but next year I’m

>>>>>>> I knew about Diabetes UK and I followed them on Facebook. When I
signed up for Swim22, I joined a separate Facebook page for everyone taking
part. People post about how they’re doing, if they’re struggling. It’s a
really supportive place. You get regular emails, there are league tables and
there’s website to log your lengths. It felt like I was part of a community.
