Last month we asked our members to share their thoughts on the products you'd
like to see the Australian Government subsidise through the National Diabetes
Services Scheme (NDSS). Thank you to everyone who provided feedback on what
was most important to you. It helped shape our submission to the Department of
Diabetes NSW & ACT used our submission to voice the concerns of our members
about several products that are not currently or adequately subsidised. Your
feedback clearly told us that when it came to managing your diabetes, the
expensive equipment and technology was unaffordable, and the small expenses
quickly added up to become big ticket items in your weekly budget. That’s why
we asked that lancets be added to the subsidy list.
We want to ensure that the decision about changing a lancet, is a decision
about what’s best for your health, not about affordability. In a recent social
media recent poll nearly 55% of respondents told us they were using the same
lancet 20 or more times to economise. So this is definitely something we
Similarly, we asked for the BD AutoShield to be covered, because it is so

or in constant use. Even periodic use can identify the best management
practices, and help to stabilise issues experienced, reducing the risks of
preventable hospitalisation and complications of diabetes. However, it costs
Diabetes NSW & ACT has asked for Freestyle Libre to be made affordable and

particular groups such as first time insulin-users, those experiencing
repeated hypoglycaemic episodes, people managing diabetes alongside other
health conditions, women with gestational diabetes, people in aged care and
disability facilities, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.
Diabetes NSW & ACT used our submission to highlight how technology can help
reduce the psychological impact of the relentless management of diabetes. We
believe it is important for the Government to know that having access to
affordable technology can positively affect a person’s physical and mental
health, reduce the risk complications and help ease the daily challenges
