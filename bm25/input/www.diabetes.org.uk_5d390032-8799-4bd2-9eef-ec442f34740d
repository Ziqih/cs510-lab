## How to look after your emotional and mental wellbeing
Not being able to go out as much or avoid other people is a difficult thing to
do. But having diabetes to think about as well as everything else in life can
feel overwhelming. Stress can affect your blood sugar levels, so we’ve got
some useful advice to help you manage all sorts of emotions, including stress.
Make sure you know your sick day rules. And if you usually use diabetes tech
and supplies, make sure you've got these to hand – like hypo treatments or
blood glucose and ketone testing tech. If you’re self-isolating or shielding,
don't forget to let friends and family know and keep them regularly updated.
### Set goals and stick to a routine
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle at home during this time might be easier said
than done, but it’s important to try to eat well and avoid drinking too much
or smoking. Now could be a great time to do some online diabetes education.
Check out our Learning Zone, full of videos, tips and tools to help you feel

Some people are seeing this time as an opportunity to recharge and reconnect
what’s important to you, like starting a new hobby or reading that book you’ve
had your eye on for a while. But it’s easy to put pressure on yourself too,
think about what makes you happy and try not to be influenced by those around
If following the news is making you anxious, switch off for a while or limit
yourself to one or two checks per day. Make time for soothing activities to
help you relax and heal – things that have worked well for you in the past are
likely to be the most helpful to you now.
Connecting with other people and talking about things can help relieve some
mental pressures. It’s important to remember that you are not alone. Find out
all the ways we can help you stay in touch with others.

## What to eat when you’re stuck at home

and wellbeing. No specific food or supplement can prevent you from catching
coronavirus, but eating a well-balanced diet can help your immune system to
Healthy eating can help you manage your diabetes, as well as help you reduce
And if you're spending more time indoors, you may not be getting enough
vitamin D from sunlight to help keep your bones and muscles healthy. Consider
buying vitamin D supplements from the supermarket or a pharmacy, and take 10
micrograms a day. You can also get small amount of vitamin D from oily fish
Sometimes we don’t feel like eating certain foods. Sometimes we just snack
because we’re bored or stressed. But this can make you feel worse in the long
run, and impact your diabetes. We’ve got information to help you tackle these
sorts of feelings about food, like starting a food diary or simply getting
To help with keeping a routine, try to have fairly structured meal times. Try
to avoid sitting front of the TV while you eat, and if you can, have a chat
with your housemates or family members while cooking or eating.
And at this difficult time, you may struggle to get the kinds of foods you
prefer and usually eat. Try not to worry if you’re having to eat a bit
differently, just eat healthy food as much as possible and be mindful of
portion sizes. We’re here to help you come up with new ideas of what to cook
from your store cupboard and give you suggestions on adjusting recipes using

If your food shopping trips should just be for essentials, be sure to take a
list with you to help stock up on essentials and avoid impulse buys.
If you’re finding it hard to get your usual foods, it can be frustrating, but
you could use it as an opportunity to try something new. For example, you
could get wraps, wholegrain muffins or crumpets instead of your usual loaf of
bread. All of these freeze well and topped with tomato puree, plenty of
veggies and a little grated mature reduced fat cheese make great alternative
* Grains - If the shop is out of instant rice, why not swap it with couscous or brown rice, which you can pair with curries or stews. They also contain more fibre, which is essential for digestive health and can help you to keep your blood glucose and cholesterol under control. 
* Vegetables - Why not try frozen veg you would not normally buy or and tinned veg in water, these both work well in pasta, stew and soup dishes
* Fruit - If you’re having trouble getting hold of fresh or tinned fruit in natural juice, have a look for frozen fruit, or alternatively if all you can find is fruit in syrup you can simply drain and rinse this before use. They will still count towards your five-a-day. 
* Eggs - If you’re having trouble finding your usual eggs, try swapping with egg whites in cartons. 
* Pasta sauce - If you can’t find any in stores, why not try making your own? Simply dry fry an onion, soften it with a little water, and add tinned tomatoes and any dried herbs you have to hand. If you don’t have tinned tomatoes try using sundried tomatoes or chopped fresh tomatoes. 
Struggling for inspiration with what you’ve got in the cupboard or freezer?
Start your day at home with this healthy porridge recipe. Any berries and nuts
would work well here and use whatever milk you have available. If you can, try
to go for unsweetened versions. Oats are high in fibre and contain a specific
type of soluble fibre called beta-glucan which can help regulate cholesterol.
This noodle dish is great for all the family and really easy to make. You can
use whatever veg you have in the freezer. Perfect for lunch or dinner. This
recipe uses chicken, but you could swap for oily fish, or a vegetarian
alternative. Try not to use red or processed meat as these have links with
heart problems and cancers. With fresh vegetables difficult to get hold of,
don’t overlook any veg that you might normally put in your compost bin, such
as any that might be starting to wilt.
Try this bean stew for dinner. Any combination of beans and lentils would work
for this recipe, just check the cooking instructions. If you can’t find tinned
beans, see if dried ones are available and follow the instructions on the
packet. This might make the stew slightly more time consuming to make, but
cooking can be a great way to pass the time.
You can make use of the herbs and spices you have in the cupboard for this
recipe. Paprika will work fine if you don’t have chilli, or use a pinch of
thyme or rosemary in place of oregano. This recipe contains lots of fibre
which can help manage your diabetes. Fibre helps to keep your gut healthy and
can reduce your cholesterol levels. Slow cookers are great to make stews and
soups and can help stretch out ingredients. If you don’t have one a casserole
This Thai chicken stir fry is another great dinner option. Stir fries are an
ideal way to help you get your five-a-day, and you can add in whatever you
have to hand. It’s also fairly low-carb, making it a good choice for those
following a low-carb diet. Ordinary onions will work fine for this recipe if
you don’t have spring onions, or you could even use leeks. You could also swap
chicken out with pork, beef, prawns or salmon. The basil adds flavour, but
Looking for a fun activity to do with your kids? You could try baking this
delicious blackberry and apple cake. You could even turn baking into a science
and geography lesson with the kids, and look on the internet and find out why
ingredients change when they are cooked or combined together and where the
ingredients come from. Any berries would work for this recipe, fresh or
frozen, or if you can’t find anything you could simply use extra apple. You
could even use dried fruit if that’s what you’ve got to hand. This recipe
contains minimal free sugars which can be helpful for managing blood sugars.
And the good news is that you can freeze most things. It’s useful to do this
so you always have food to hand if canned or frozen food runs low in your
local shop. It’s also a great way to make the most of your food, and your

Getting active can be anything that gets you moving more and – even better –
* Hoovering the house and cleaning all the windows 
* A spot of DIY– time to tackle that shelf you’ve been putting off

If you need to start off at an easier pace, try standing during a TV advert.
If you can manage it, work towards standing for the whole advert break, then
