The Easter eggs and hot-cross buns have hit the shelves and for many people
living with diabetes this can be a hard time to navigate. Often loved ones
show love and appreciation with chocolate eggs, bunnies and bilbies. Lots of
these gifts can make it more challenging to manage blood glucose levels over
the Easter period. The following tips will help you overcome this challenge
Chocolate is a treat and not something you should be eating every day. When
enjoying chocolate around Easter time try to be mindful of you portion size
Eating mindfully can help enhance our nutrition, quality of life and help
maintain a healthy weight. It's especially important to eat mindfully when
eating treat foods such as chocolate, so as not to overindulge. Remember to
eat foods slowly and avoid distractions. Eating in front of the TV, computer
or even while looking at your phone can mean you end up eating more – and not
just at that sitting but later in the day as well. Choosing small individual
eggs over large ones can help you to be mindful as you take your time to
unwrap them and think about what you are eating at the time.
Next time you are planning to have a mini chocolate Easter egg pick it up and
place it in the palm of your hand. Notice the shape and colour of the
wrapping, how does the light fall on it? Think about the texture of the
wrapping. How heavy does the egg feel? Slowly unwrap the egg. Think about the
sound the wrapping makes as you open it. Notice the movement of your hands as
you unwrap the egg. Smell the chocolate. How does it make you feel? Is your
mouth watering? Is your stomach grumbling? Take a bite of the chocolate. Do
not chew or swallow yet. Feel the texture of the chocolate in your mouth as it
melts. Notice the flavours on your tongue. After savouring the flavours for a
few minutes and when ready swallow the chocolate. Once finished think about
the lingering flavours from the chocolate and how you are feeling.
If you eat straight from a packet it is hard to keep track of how much you
have eaten. This can mean you end up eating more than you think. Avoid eating
from packets or snacking on large Easter bunnies or eggs and instead portion
When choosing chocolate opt for a good quality dark chocolate. This will have
flavanols which have an antioxidant effect. The other bonus of dark chocolate
is that it has a slightly bitter flavour and is less tempting to over indulge.
All chocolate, including dark chocolate, tends to be high in saturated fat,
added sugar and kilojoules so it is still important to limit the amount you
eat. For this reason still aim to only have small amounts. To help put this
into perspective one medium egg (9-8cm) will have more than double the
kilojoules of two mini eggs and one large egg (13cm) will have about seven
times the kilojoules. That could be more kilojoules than in a whole meal in
Having regular balanced meals that contain quality carbohydrate that is higher
in fibre and have a lower glycemic index (GI), lean protein and lots of
veggies will help keep those hungry-hormones under control. This means we are
less likely to overdo it when we do have the occasional Easter treat. For more

Don’t be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to Easter celebrations.
As a fun snack serve up hummus in mini flower pots with baby carrots for
dipping. Add a twig parsley to the top of each carrot to replicate freshly
picked carrots. If you need a fresh hummus recipe check out:
When making sandwiches or toast cut them into fun bunny or egg shapes. You
could even add a little extra fruit to decorate a bowl of porridge for a bit
When it comes to giving gifts it doesn’t have to be food related. Make your
own Easter basket with pampering creams or moisturising oils and decorate with
plastic eggs or a little faux hay. For children soft toy bunnies are a lasting
For many Australians the extra kilojoules from chocolate eggs or hot-cross
buns lathered in butter can make it much harder to manage weight. However for
those at with or at risk of malnutrition these extra kilojoules may be useful.
Malnutrition is thought to affect one in ten Australian’s over the age of 65
years and another forty percent are at risk. Save your Easter chocolate to use
as a gift for an older loved one in residential care. Of course it is
essential to check with age care staff to make sure it is appropriate first.
Don’t forget it is essential to move more especially if adding in extra
kilojoules over Easter. Instead of egg hunts consider treasure hunts with
