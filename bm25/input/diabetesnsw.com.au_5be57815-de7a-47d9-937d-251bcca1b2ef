With temperatures continuing to rise over summer it’s important to keep
yourself healthy in the heat, particularly if you live with diabetes. Here are
our top 10 tips for staying safe when the heat comes in:

site close to normal temperature and stay hydrated.
3\. Avoid alcohol and caffeine as they cause dehydration.
