Today the Government announced changes to the Continuous Glucose Monitoring
(CGM) Initiative opening access to this life changing technology to thousands
Diabetes Australia CEO Professor Greg Johnson welcomed Freestyle Libre’s
inclusion on the CGM Initiative and the streamlining of eligibility criteria
as important steps to help ensure people who need this life changing
From 1 March 2020, people with type 1 diabetes aged over 21, with a valid
concession card free access to glucose monitoring devices.
“In the past three years we have seen the number of people with type 1
diabetes able to access life-changing glucose monitoring technology grow
“Today’s announcement means that around 50 per cent of all people with type 1
diabetes in Australia will now have free access to this technology.
Continuous and Flash glucose monitors are small wearable devices that monitor
glucose levels automatically, providing readings every few minutes. People
with diabetes can see their glucose levels using apps on their smart phones.
Both continuous and Flash glucose monitoring devices reduce the need for
finger prick checks and give a lot more information to the person with type 1
diabetes and their healthcare team about glucose trends and “time on range”
“Previously, people had to meet a high risk or high need criteria which was
difficult for some people. The new process is much more straightforward and
has removed this administrative burden for eligible people with type 1
diabetes. If you have a valid concession card you can get access,” Professor
Professor Johnson said Diabetes Australia, its state organisations and
alliance partners - the ADS, the ADEA, APEG and JDRF Australia - would
continue to work with Government to increase affordable access to diabetes
“We welcome today’s announcement as another critical step in the journey to
ensure more people with diabetes can access life changing diabetes monitoring
“But we’re not done yet! We will continue working with Government towards our
goal that every person with diabetes, who needs access to these technologies
can access them. It’s a continually changing world with new devices, upgrades,
Diabetes Australia and its state organisations will continue to work with the
Government and the diabetes sector, to advocate for affordable and easy access
