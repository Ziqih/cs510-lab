There are four common causes that make our blood glucose levels fluctuate and
each can have an impact on the management of your diabetes. Find out just how
food, physical activity, medication and illness can impact your BGL's.
The type and quantity of food you eat (particularly carbohydrates) affect your
blood glucose levels. All carbohydrates are broken down into glucose in the
body. The effect of a meal on blood glucose levels will depend on the
**_quality_** (type) and the **_quantity_** (amount) of the carbohydrates in
***Quality:** Nutrient-rich carbohydrate foods (e.g. fibre-rich chickpeas) break down into glucose more slowly so blood glucose levels rise slowly, keeping you feeling fuller for longer. These foods are referred to as lower glycaemic index (GI) foods. Highly processed, high GI foods digest and absorb into the bloodstream quickly, which causes large, rapid changes in blood glucose levels.
***Quantity:** If you can keep the amount of carbohydrates you eat at meals and snacks consistent throughout the day, you may find your blood glucose levels become steadier and easier to manage.
A general guide would be two to four serves of carbohydrate (30-60 grams of
carbohydrate) at main meals and one to two serves (15-30 grams of
There are many benefits to being physically active such as helping to manage
your blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of diseases such as stroke and
heart attack, assisting with weight management, increasing strength and
When you exercise your muscles need glucose for energy. This energy comes from
glucose in the blood and stored glucose (in muscles and the liver). Physical
activity can lower your blood glucose levels for up to 48 hours after exercise
as your body become more sensitive to insulin. If you are on insulin or other
glucose lowering medications check your blood glucose levels before, during
and after exercise to ensure they are not dropping too low. It is important to
Some types of exercise can temporarily increase blood glucose levels for one
to two hours before they settle again and are not a cause of concern. The
increase is due to a stress response in the body which often happens during
When you are sick, even with a simple cold, your blood glucose levels can
fluctuate quite a lot. Sickness causes stress hormones to be released by your
body. These hormones trigger the liver to increase the amount of glucose in
your blood and your body’s insulin becomes more resistant. Both of these
things can make it more difficult to control your blood glucose levels. Some
illness such as vomiting and diarrhoea can cause blood glucose levels to drop.
See your doctor if this happens as your blood glucose levels may become too
If you are sick it is important to see your doctor to treat the underlying
sickness that is causing the blood glucose level fluctuations. Also if you
have a sickness plan, start to follow it. Keep eating and drinking to avoid
One of the most common medications which affect blood glucose levels are
**steroids**. These medications typically increase blood glucose levels as
they reduce the action of insulin and also cause the liver to release stored
glucose into the blood stream. Steroid medications are often used to treat
asthma, arthritis and dermatitis. Sometimes a person undergoing chemotherapy
If you are given steroid medications make sure that you discuss with your
doctor how to manage the effect they may have on your blood glucose levels.
Similarly if you start on any new medication and you notice changes in your

heartbeat so blood glucose levels should be checked regularly if you are
taking beta blockers. Discuss this side effect with your doctor if you have
