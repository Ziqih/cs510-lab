* What should I do if I have pre-diabetes?
* Care plans: what you need to know
* Type 2 diabetes and me – online course
Living with type 1 diabetes for over 27 years certainly isn’t a walk in the
park. I will never forget laying on the hospital bed shy of nine years of age
looking up at my mother and promising that one day I would share with the
world the untold truths of diabetes (#unspokendiabetes). I was only just
diagnosed but I could already sense my world was about to turn upside down.
The syringes back then, the finger pricking, the carb counting, the highs, the
lows, the ketoacidosis, the coma, the stigma, the endless doctors
appointments, the risks of complications, the warnings of falling pregnant,
the reduced life expectancy and the increased risk of complications the longer
you lived with diabetes. To a nine year old it was a slow death sentence.
Fast forward to today and I work in the healthcare field as a clinical
optometrist with a special interest in diabetes eye related conditions. I
lecture on diabetes and clinical eye care and freelance write and present
Everyone has a story. Each unique in its own right. Mine incorporates living
with my husband (who also has type 1 diabetes- and no we didn't meet at a
diabetes camp) and my two beautiful boys, as a health care professional
certainly didn’t make me immune to diabetes related complications with a
transplant being my most recent chapter in my diabetes journey.
Diabetes and diabetes management is multidimensional. For long term management
to be impactful and meaningful it needs to be patient centred, individually
customised and holistic where the two-way conversation influences how we go
My hope is that I can be a voice and a catalyst connecting both health care
professionals and patients to close the gap in diabetes health care and well
