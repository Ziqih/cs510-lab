into the blood when needed, such as when blood sugar levels drop. But alcohol
stands in the way of the liver’s ability to do this effectively. If you’re not

can’t face food or you’ve been sick, drink as many fluids as you can,
including some sugary (non-diet) drinks if your blood sugar levels are low.

choose the types of drinks best for you:
