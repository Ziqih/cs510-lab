# Radar and AI used to monitor blood glucose
Researchers have developed new technology that can quickly and accurately
monitor blood glucose levels without painful finger pricks.
The palm-sized device developed by University of Waterloo uses radar and
artificial intelligence (AI) to read blood inside the human body.
“Our device is non-invasive. The key advantage is simply no pricking,” said
“That is extremely important for people living with diabetes. Especially the
elderly who might have sensitive skin or children who require multiple tests
The new device works by sending radio waves through the skin and into blood
vessels when users place the tip of their finger on a touchpad.
The waves are reflected back to the device for analysis by AI software,
telling users within seconds whether their blood glucose has gone up, down or
Changes are measured in relation to a baseline reading that would be obtained
every few weeks with a glucometer or a laboratory blood test to ensure
“Our safe, reusable, pain-free device eliminates the need for implanted
sensors, patches or devices that use chemical reactions or fluid transfer
Researchers are now exploring commercialization of the technology. This
includes developing a wearable device similar to a smartwatch that would be on
“This finding paves the way for continuous monitoring,” said Shaker. “Given
the current pace of progress, I expect the technology to be available in a
wearable form within the next couple of years.”
Ali Safavi-Naeini, also an engineering professor at Waterloo, said the science
at the heart of the diabetes device potentially has several additional
“Since many ingredients of blood have distinct electromagnetic properties,
this technology could be used for other types of blood analysis and medical
