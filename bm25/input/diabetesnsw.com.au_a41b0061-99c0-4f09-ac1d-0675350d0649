... Chronic disease risk factors a ticking time bomb
# Chronic disease risk factors a ticking time bomb
Australians are being urged not to ignore their long-term risk of chronic
disease during COVID-19, as a new report highlights overweight and obesity as
a major risk factor affecting two in three Australian adults.
The new Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report _Australia’s Health
2020_ shows that, while Australians are living longer, some risk factors like
overweight and obesity have been steadily increasing over the past few
Sharon McGowan Chair of the Australian Chronic Disease Prevention Alliance
said this trend was particularly concerning given the sheer number of people
“We know that overweight and obesity increase risk of many chronic diseases
like type 2 diabetes, stroke, heart disease, chronic kidney disease and many
cancers. But, more recently we have also discovered that obesity increases
risk of severe disease from COVID-19,” Ms McGowan said.
Smoking also increases risk of severe disease from COVID-19, as does having a
 **“While the world is focusing on COVID-19, it is clear that chronic diseases
and their risk factors cannot be overlooked,” said Ms McGowan.**
The new report highlighted that one in two Australians have a chronic disease.
Each day 400 people are diagnosed with cancer and 100 have a stroke. Other
sources show that 280 people develop diabetes each day.
Certain population groups are disproportionately affected by chronic diseases
and their risk factors. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are two
times as likely to have coronary heart disease compared to non-Indigenous
Australians, and more than three times as likely to die from type 2 diabetes
or chronic kidney disease, or have a stroke 10 years younger than non-
Some risk factors, like smoking and obesity, are more prevalent in people
living in rural and remote and/or lower socioeconomic areas compared to those
Ms McGowan said that much chronic disease burden could be prevented, but the
link between risk factors and chronic disease is poorly understood by members
“Australians should be supported to understand their risk of chronic disease
and manage their health before it becomes an emergency,” Ms McGowan said.
The new report shows that one in 15 hospitalisations is potentially
preventable and nearly half of these are due to chronic conditions at a cost
At the same time, the report estimates that more than 80 percent of the
“Primary and community health care centres are ideal places to ask people
about their health, conduct risk assessments and provide the right support or
intervention to help people manage their risk,” said Ms McGowan.
“With knowledge and support, many risk factors and conditions can be managed
out of hospital, providing a better quality of life for Australians, reducing
complications and easing the burden on the hospital system.”
Ms McGowan highlighted telehealth (video and phone consultations) and pop-up
testing clinics as recent government initiatives to improve access to care for
Ms McGowan said, “If we’ve learned anything from COVID-19, it is that
government support for prevention, early detection and intervention can pay
huge dividends in reducing the risk of serious conditions and complications.”
“Chronic conditions and their risk factors need the same long-term commitment
to population health to prevent a tsunami of disease in the coming months and
