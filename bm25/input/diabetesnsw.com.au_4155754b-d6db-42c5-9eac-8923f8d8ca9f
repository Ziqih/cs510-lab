Your blood glucose level (BGL) is affected by a number of things including
exercise, physical activity, medications, stress, illness, alcohol and in
particular the food you eat. Checking and recording your BGL regularly will
help you to see and monitor the effect of a healthy diet and lifestyle
choices. It will also assist your doctor and your diabetes care team to make
decisions when changes to how your diabetes is managed, need to be made.
Checking your BGL will help you develop the confidence needed to look after
your diabetes. Monitoring will also let you know immediately if your glucose
level is too high (hyperglycaemia) or too low (hypoglycaemia). It is important
to know what your glucose level is so you can make decisions about sick day
management, exercise and whether you need to treat a low glucose level.
Knowing your glucose levels will also be a big help when you ask your team
about dose adjustment for insulin, your diabetes tablets, planning your meals
and if and when your blood glucose targets aren’t being met.
Your doctor or diabetes educator will advise you of your target BGL and let
you know how often you should be checking your level. The number of BGL checks
you’ll be asked to do generally depends on your diabetes management and the
medications you take. Most glucose monitors have an inbuilt memory that
records your BGL as you do them; however, your team may still ask you to keep
a manual record. It’s best to take your monitor as well as your record diary
The ideal times to check your BGL are fasting (before your first meal of the
day) and no sooner than two hours after food. These times will give your team
a good idea of how your medications are working and where to make adjustments
if necessary. Sometimes you may be asked to check your BGL more often. This
can be because your level of activity has changed or your routine has changed,
for example, when you go travelling or on holiday, or if adjustments have been
made to your medications, or if your levels are unpredictably high or low.
