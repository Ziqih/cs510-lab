# Managing eye problems when you have diabetes
### You can prevent your eye disease getting worse – but you need to act now.
If your eyesight has been damaged by retinopathy, the hard truth is, you’re at
But taking the right steps now can stop things getting worse.
If you’ve been told you have early stage retinopathy, there are lots of things
you can do to delay or prevent it from progressing. If it’s more advanced,
your healthcare team will talk to you about the different treatment options.
1,600 people lose their sight every year to diabetes
All the same advice on preventing retinopathy applies here - whether you have
signs of eye problems or not, managing your diabetes is critical now.
* Keep blood sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure at your target levels - your healthcare team may give you blood pressure tablets even if you don’t have high blood pressure.
* Get your eyes screened every year - to check for any changes in your eyes.
* Take your diabetes medication - to manage your blood sugar levels.
* Keep to a healthy weight by eating well and moving more.
* Stop smoking \- smoking increases your blood pressure and your blood sugar levels, making it harder for you to manage your diabetes.
All these things can reduce your risk of more damage and so prevent or delay
your eyes from getting worse. And it’s not just about eye problems, the more
you do these things, the lower your risk of developing serious problems with
And you can get support with all of this, you’re not alone. We’ve made a
checklist of the essential checks and services you’re entitled to when you
have diabetes. These are your 15 Healthcare Essentials and they’re all free.
If your retinopathy is more advanced, you’ll need treatment or you risk losing
The type of treatment you have will depend on how advanced the damage is. Your
healthcare team will talk to you about the treatment best for you. These will
We know some of these treatments may sound daunting, but the treatment is so
And again, managing your diabetes is essential now. We keep saying this but
This is the most common treatment for retinopathy. If you have this treatment
and manage your blood sugar levels well, it can prevent eye damage getting
worse. But it won’t usually improve your sight.
An eye specialist (called an ophthalmologist) will talk you through what’s
going to happen when you have laser treatment. They’ll also tell you about any
risks involved – yes, there are possible side effects involved, but the
benefit to you and your eyes will outweigh the possible risks.
We’ll now give you some more information about what to expect at laser
treatment, but remember you can ask your healthcare team any questions you
And ask someone to go with you, so they can help you home after the treatment.
You won’t usually need to stay overnight, but you may need more than one
session – talk to your eye specialist about this.
#### What to expect when you have laser treatment
* Your eye specialist will give you a local anaesthetic to numb your eyes.
* They’ll give you eye drops to make your pupils bigger.
* A special contact lens is then put on your eye to hold your eyelids open.
* Small bursts of laser beams are focused on one part of your eye. This can feel painful, as you may feel a sharp sensation when certain areas are treated. 
* The treatment will take around half an hour.
Most people describe feeling slightly dazzled and find their vision is
affected for a short time after treatment. This should pass after a few hours.
Take sunglasses to wear afterwards as everything will look very bright.
And you won’t be able to drive or get home on your own, so you’ll need someone
Laser treatment can cause a bit of swelling in your eye, which can make your
eyesight worse. But this normally gets better in a few weeks.
If you need a few sessions, there’s a risk that your sight may be affected
permanently. This is because the laser beams can affect healthy parts of the
eye, as well as the unhealthy parts. Some people find it harder to see in low
light, to recognise colours or they sometimes see shimmering or flashing
So although these can be uncomfortable side effects, they won’t be as bad as
the sight loss you could have if you don’t get the right treatment.
If you have maculopathy (swelling in the eye), you can have injections of a
drug to treat it. This drug can slow down the damage and quickly improve your
eyesight. Most people need a few injections, normally once a month.
#### What to expect when you have eye injections
* You’ll have the injections as an outpatient, which means you won’t have to stay the night. 
* You’ll be given antibiotic eye drops a few days before your treatment or just before – this helps prevent an infection.
* On the day, you’ll see an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specialises in eyes) who will give you numbing eye drops so the injections won’t be painful. You might find this a bit uncomfortable but it won’t hurt.
* The doctor will inject your eyes with a drug called anti-VEGF.
* The needle is very sharp, small and short. The injection itself only takes a few seconds and feels like a tiny scratch.
* Your eye pressure is measured afterwards, to reduce any risk of further problems after the injections.
You don’t need to wear sunglasses after you have the injections, but you
should ask someone to help you get home because your vision will be blurry for
a little while. This should get better after a few hours.
Most people notice their eyesight getting better a month after their first
injection. But you’ll need to go back for more injections every month, until
you don’t notice any more improvements in your vision for three months. That
means it’s worked and you can stop having the treatment.
You’ll still have follow-up appointments and it’s really important you go to
Your eye pressure may go up for a few hours and if it stays high you may need
treatment to bring it down. Your healthcare team will keep a close check on
And you might see the medicine floating around your eye for the next few
weeks. This is completely normal but can seem a little strange.
If other treatments don’t work, steroids can help people with severe damage to
their eyes. Steroids are drugs that can reduce inflammation, and so help with
any swelling in your eye. Your healthcare team will explain all of this to
you, but here’s some information to help you feel prepared.
#### What to expect when you have steroid treatment
* An ophthalmologist will give you a local anaesthetic to numb the eye area.
* You’ll be given antibiotic eye drops too, to help prevent infection.
* The doctor then uses an injection to put a tiny implant containing the steroid into the eye. 
* The implant slowly releases the drug over three years. 
You won’t have both eyes treated at the same time so your doctor will talk to
you about when to come in for your next session.
You should notice improvements within about a month of having the implant put
in. And you’ll have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to check
how the implant is working, and they may talk to you about having laser
Your eyesight may be affected straight away so you’ll need to ask someone to
Like all of these treatments, you may have side effects like some eye
pressure, floaters in your vision and some pain in the eye. These should clear
up but always let your doctor know if you’re worried about any of these.
This is an operation called vitreoretinal surgery. You’ll need to stay
overnight in hospital and have a general anaesthetic. This is a major
procedure and can sound pretty daunting, but may be your best treatment option
How well it works depends on a number of factors so you’ll need to speak to
your eye specialist about the risks involved and what’s likely to happen
