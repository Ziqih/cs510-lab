challenge. But it’s not a challenge you have to face alone. Here we share
stories from people who recall how they came to terms with their diagnosis and

>>>>>>> Neil HunterDiagnosed with type 2 in 2005
>>>>>>> I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2005, when I was 34. It was a
bit of a bolt out of the blue. I was in the Royal Navy at the time and had to
have a routine medical because I was changing my house insurance. I had no
symptoms, so it was quite lucky really that I found out then.
>>>>>>> There was a lot of ignorance on my part. I’d heard of type 2 diabetes,
but I didn’t really know what it was. I know so much more about it now. At the
time, I thought it was associated with obesity and bad diet and so on. That
was a preconceived idea I had then, which I think follows through to what a
lot of people think about the condition today.
>>>>>>> I didn’t really think, ‘why me?’ I was told it was just one of those
>>>>>>> Amanda SkingleDiagnosed with type 1 in 2001
>>>>>>> I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2001, aged 18. I got all the
usual symptoms, the thirst, going to the loo a lot, and I lost a lot of
weight. I had a blood test and was at work later that day when I got a phone
call the same day saying I had to get to the hospital immediately.
>>>>>>> I was a bit numb. I don’t think I took in half of what I was being
told. They showed me how to do injections and I had to show them I could do
it, but it’s obviously a complete lifestyle change. I was 18, just finished
college, just started my first job in a travel agent, and I didn’t want to
watch what I was eating and drinking, inject insulin or test my blood sugar. I
>>>>>>> I didn’t deal with it, which is why I’m in the pickle that I’m in now.
>>>>>>> ##My diagnosis came as quite a shock
>>>>>>> In 2018, I noticed I was weeing a lot. Leading up to that, I had a bit
of numbness in my leg – I don’t know if that was related or not.
>>>>>>> I did a bit of Googling and my biggest fear was that I maybe had
>>>>>>> When I went to my doctor they did a test and told me I was prediabetic
– where your blood sugar levels are higher than usual, but not high enough to
be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I thought, ‘I’ll take that in a heartbeat
over bladder cancer. I can do something about that.’
>>>>>>> But I was also like, ‘me? Really?!’
>>>>>>> There’s a lot of stereotyping around type 2. People think, ‘oh she
>>>>>>> I suppose I was guilty of that myself. People think, ‘oh, she’s
athletic, she can’t have type 2!’ But there are many genetic and lifestyle
>>>>>>> My brush with diabetes made me realise that, in the black community,
we don’t really speak about type 2 diabetes that much, despite the fact that
>>>>>>> Now, I want to really educate black people. It’s not a crime that
you’ve got type 2 diabetes, but what can you do about it? And how can we
prevent our sisters, nephews, nieces, cousins, from getting it? We don’t talk
about these things enough, and that’s part of the problem. We need to talk
>>>>>>> I want to show women, particularly black women, that it’s time to get
out there, try new things and make ourselves more visible.

>>>>>>> Chris CookDiagnosed with diabetes in summer 2007 at the age of 33
>>>>>>> It wasn't until the end of the first year of my postgraduate research
degree in accessible public transport, that I was first diagnosed with type 2
diabetes. There’s no history of it in my family and it’s not related to my
>>>>>>> At first the diagnosis seemed like yet another condition to have to
come to terms with and when I was unable to control it with diet alone, I had
to begin a regime of Metformin and Gliclazide tablets and subsequently a daily
Liraglutide (Victoza) injection. I quickly realised that another course of
major adjustment in my life had arrived, when I was least expecting it.
>>>>>>> I was born with a condition called "Riley-Day Syndrome" or to give it
its full title "Familial Dysautonomia". I fortunately only have some parts of
this condition, which mainly affects my body's sensitivity to pain and
temperature. This means that I need to be particularly careful when bathing,
showering or cooking that I don't accidently scald myself and not realise it
>>>>>>> After having suffered a routine bout of conjunctivitis as a baby,
which deteriorated into a serious eye infection, which resulted in both my
corneas being damaged, the decision was taken to perform corneal grafts on
both eyes, in order to attempt to restore my sight.
>>>>>>> Unfortunately, another trait of Riley Day Syndrome presented itself
following the surgery, which is that my body creates excess scar tissue round
wounds and so the grafts were never able to take fully. The first eight years
of my life were mainly spent either in hospital having more corneal grafts
performed or being schooled at home by a mixture of my parents and various
>>>>>>>> I'd be lying if I said that these early years of my life weren't
traumatic, but I had the resilience which many children are blessed with, to
be able to adapt to major changes in their lives together with the unwavering
>>>>>>> I also had my love of railways and trains, which has been with me
since birth and which will be with me for the rest of my life.
>>>>>>> I had to learn new, safe ways of finding my way around, learning
braille so that I could read once again and learning to touch type, so that
I'd still be able to communicate with the outside sighted world, which I'd
>>>>>>>> All these skills still stand me in great stead today, especially the
ability to touch type. In those days, I was using either a manual or an
electric typewriter, whereas today I'm typing this article on a PC. The
ability to communicate by whatever means is nevertheless an absolutely
>>>>>>> At the age of 11, I began attending a boarding school for the blind in
Worcester, which still exists today. In the eight years I spent there, we were
taught to live independent lives, to navigate safely round the town centre, do
our own shopping, cooking and washing and to travel safely on public transport
>>>>>>> I did my GCSEs and A-levels and Worcester and then went on to read
modern languages at the University of Wales, Swansea, before deciding to
specialise in public transport and complete my postgraduate research degree in
>>>>>>> MahnDiagnosed with type 1 diabetes aged 11
>>>>>>> Mahn’s diagnosis was the worst day of my life. Because his dad has
type 1 he had that understanding of what it meant. I remember the first thing
he said to me in the hospital was “Am I going to have hypos like daddy?”. That
was his biggest fear. I was very emotional and really we were just in shock.
>>>>>>> I did ask then at the hospital whether there was any research he’d be
able to take part in, but they told us not to worry about that just now and to
concentrate on sorting out his blood sugars. But having type 1 diabetes
myself, I thought research and having the chance to access a new type of
treatment might help and would certainly be better than nothing.
>>>>>>> I searched on the internet and looked through hundreds of clinical
trials that came up. I was concentrating on phase 3 ones, and that’s how we
>>>>>>> What we didn’t know at the time was how tight the window is to get in
there for these immunotherapy trials - it’s only a few weeks from the point
you’re diagnosed. That’s because the treatment is trying to preserve beta
cells and they need to give it to you quickly, before too many cells get
destroyed by the immune system. We were already three weeks into Mahn’s
diagnosis at this point and I realised we had to act fast.
