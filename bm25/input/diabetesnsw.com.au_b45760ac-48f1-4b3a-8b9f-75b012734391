# Can oranges reduce the risk of diabetes?
Researchers at Western University have shown a molecule, called nobiletin,
found in sweet oranges and tangerines, can drastically reduce obesity and the
The study has found that the equivalent of just two and a half glasses of
orange juice a day could reverse obesity and reduce the risk of heart disease
The research published in the Journal of Lipid Research demonstrates that mice
fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet that were also given nobiletin were
noticeably leaner and had reduced levels of insulin resistance and blood fats
compared to mice that were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet alone.
Professor Murray Huff who has been studying nobiletin’s effects for over a
decade said “We’ve shown that in mice that already have all the negative
symptoms of obesity, we can use nobelitin to reverse those symptoms, and even
start to regress plaque build-up in the arteries, known as atherosclerosis.”
But Huff says he and his team still haven’t been able to pinpoint exactly how
nobiletin works. The researchers hypothesized that the molecule was likely
acting on the pathway that regulates how fat is handled in the body. Called
AMP Kinase, this regulator turns on the machinery in the body that burns fats
to create energy, and it also blocks the manufacture of fats.
However, when the researchers studied nobiletin’s effects on mice that had
been genetically modified to remove AMP Kinase, the effects were the same.
“This result told us that nobiletin is not acting on AMP Kinase, and is
bypassing this major regulator of how fat is used in the body,” said Huff.
“What it still leaves us with is the question – how is nobiletin doing this?”
Huff says while the mystery remains, this result is still clinically important
because it shows that nobiletin won’t interfere with other drugs that act on
the AMP Kinase system. He says current therapeutics for diabetes like
The next step is to move these studies into humans to determine if nobiletin
has the same positive metabolic effects in human trials.
“Obesity and its resulting metabolic syndromes are a huge burden to our health
care system, and we have very few interventions that have been shown to work
effectively,” said Huff. “We need to continue this emphasis on the discovery
