### Across the UK, different nations have different laws and legislation which
has been made to look after children with medical conditions in school.
One of the most common, and the one we speak most about, is the Equality Act
2010, that affects schools in England, Scotland and Wales. For more specific
laws and legislation that has been made by your nation to help children in
The Equality Act 2010 (England, Scotland and Wales)
The NHS, local authorities and all schools in England, Scotland and Wales all
have responsibilities towards children with diabetes, who are legally defined
as being disabled. Fee-paying independent schools are also legally obliged to
meet the requirements outlined in the Equality Act 2010.
The relevant part of this act is that governing bodies or proprietors must
make reasonable adjustments to ensure that children and young people with
disability aren't put at a substantial disadvantage compared to other
Importantly, making reasonable adjustments is anticipatory, which means they
must be put in place in advance to prevent the student from being at a
This is particularly important for schools because they have enough staff
trained so that a child with diabetes can take part in all parts of school
life. If all the trained staff are away or leave, schools must have

The Children and Families Act 2014 includes a duty on schools to support
children with medical conditions. This is inclusive of children with diabetes.
Schools must make arrangements for supporting pupils at schools with medical
conditions and in meeting that duty they must have regard to the statutory
The statutory guidance, Supporting pupils at school with medical conditions,
is available to read on the Government website, Gov.uk.

Sections 21 and 175 of the Education Act 2002 detail how governing bodies of
maintained schools must support the wellbeing of students and take
responsibility of safeguarding of children at the school.
### Section 3 of the Children Act 1989
The Children Act places a duty on any person who looks after a child to do
everything reasonable in the circumstances for safeguarding. In relation to a
child with diabetes, this will mean knowing what to do in case of an
Local authorities have legal requirements to help make sure schools can
support a child with diabetes successfully. The requirements of local
authorities refer to all children in the local authority, and they do not
depend on the kind of school the child attends.
### Section 10 of the Children Act 2004
Section 10 of the Children's Act is really important if schools are struggling
to get the support and training they need to allow them to look after a child
Section 10 means the local authority must make arrangements to encourage
collaboration between the authority and relevant partners. Relevant partners
include the governing body of a maintained school, the proprietor of an
academy, clinical commissioning groups and the NHS Commissioning Board. They
must make arrangements to improve the wellbeing of children, including their
physical and mental health, protection from harm and neglect, and education.
If a school cannot get the support it needs to look after a child with
diabetes then they must approach their local authority for support.
### Section of 17 of the Children’s Act
Section 17 gives local authorities a general responsibility to safeguard and
promote the welfare of children in need in their area. If a school is looking
after a child with diabetes inadequately which is putting the child in danger,

The CCG will decide what's necessary to meet the reasonable needs of each
This section also requires CCGs to arrange services it thinks are appropriate
to improve students physical and mental health for the people it's responsible
In regards to children with diabetes, this means that a CCG should make sure
support and healthcare in place to improve their health or at least keep them
healthy. Poor management of diabetes at school will affect the health of a
child. If a school is unable to get the support it needs to help manage a
child's diabetes successfully, both the local authority and the local CCG have
a responsibility to look after the child's health and welfare.
This joint guidance, published by the Department of Education (DE) and the
Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) in 2008, sets
out the key roles and responsibilities about the medication needs of school

The guidance requires schools to have a policy in place that ensures that
children with medication needs, such as insulin, will receive appropriate care

All schools can contact healthcare specialists for advice on medication and

Departmental guidance states that ‘reasonable steps’ should be taken by
schools to encourage pupils with medication needs to participate in school
If a member of staff gives medication to a pupil and faces expenses,
liability, loss claim or proceedings as a result, the employer must protect
* the member of staff is a direct employee;
* the medication is administered in the course of, or ancillary to, their employment;
* the member of staff follows the procedures set out in the Department of Education guidance, the school’s policy and the procedures set out in the pupil’s Medication Plan (or written permissions from parents and directions received through training in the appropriate procedures).
Since 2008, the Department of Education has made funding available to the
Education and Library Boards to provide training to all school Principals on
how to meet the needs of all pupils with medication needs, including those
The vast majority of children with diabetes do not require a Statement of
Special Education Needs. If a childs needs cannot be met within the support
normally available to the school, a request for a statutory assessment can be
made by a school, parent or other agency. This is done by writing to the
Special Education Needs section of the local Education and Library Board.
The Special Educational Needs and Disability (Northern Ireland) Order 2005
does not require or prohibit the administration of medicines to pupils.
Clauses of this legislation does state that pupils with a disability (diabetes
is recognised as such) should not be discriminated against in the education or

If a parent is unhappy about the treatment of their child in school, they can
contact the Dispute Avoidance and Resolution Service (DARS) which was
established in 2005 to resolve disagreements or disputes between Boards,
It is designed as an independent, confidential, voluntary and informal
service. It is independent of the Special Education section, and there is a
DARS contact in each Education and Library Board.
### What Diabetes Care to Expect in Schools
The Education Minister asked the five Education Boards, the Paediatric
Diabetes Specialist Nurse Regional Group, and Diabetes UK Northern Ireland to
commence work on up-to-date guidance for parents. The document ‘What Diabetes
Care to Expect in Schools’ which you can download on Northern Irelands
There are several pieces of legislation relating to the rights of children
* Children and Young Person (Scotland) Bill (passed on 19 February 2014 but not yet in force);
* NHS (Scotland) Act 1978; The Functions of Health Boards (Scotland) Order 1991;
* the Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils’ Educational Records (Scotland) Act (2003);
* Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc Act 2000;
* Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004.
The last of these are the most current and relevant for parents of children
### Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004
“The Education (Additional support for learning) (Scotland) Act (2004) places
duties on education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the
additional support needs of all pupils for whom they are responsible,
including pupils with diabetes. The Education (Disability Strategies and
Pupils’ Educational Records (Scotland) Act (2003) also places duties on bodies
responsible for schools to prepare an accessibility strategy which sets out
their plans to ensure access to the curriculum, physical environment of
schools and school information. There are also examples of good practice – for
example, in 2008 Fife Council Education Service produced a policy for the
management of diabetes in schools, which may be used country-wide.” – from
'Supporting children and young people with diabetes', RCN guidance for nurses
in schools and early years settings, Royal College of Nursing 2013.
The concept of 'additional support needs' applies to any child or young person
who, for whatever reason, needs additional support for learning. These needs
can arise from any factor which causes a barrier to learning including social,
emotional, cognitive, linguistic, disability, or family and care
circumstances. Issues arising from managing diabetes while at school can count
The impact will vary from child to child but it is how these factors impact on
the individual child's learning that is important, and this will determine the
* make enough and efficient provision for each child or young person with additional support needs, for whose education they are responsible
* keep under consideration the needs and the level of support for each child or young person with additional support needs
* take account of the additional support needs of children when providing school education generally.
* request the education authority to find out if their child has additional support needs
* request the education authority to find out if their child needs a Co-ordinated Support Plan or to review an existing plan
* request a specific type of assessment or examination.
Callum Wyper, aged 7, a student at Dykehead Primary School in Shotts, needs
support during the school day to manage his diabetes, which includes the
administration of insulin. But because of a lack of preparation by the
education authority, Callum ended up missing nearly two months of school
North Lanarkshire Council had relied on volunteers from existing school staff
to support pupils with diabetes with their insulin regimes. But when this
support was gone and the education authority failed to provide alternative
provision, Callum's mother Julie and step-father James felt they had no option
but to withdraw him from school to ensure his diabetes was safely managed. The
Additional Support Needs Tribunal decided that it would have been reasonable
to hire support staff whose duties included responsibility for the
administration of insulin. The Council were found to have unlawfully
discriminated against Callum in relation to his condition.
This case is not a 'reported decision' so can't be relied on. But it does
provide a basis for arguing for support in other schools.

In England, the Children and Families Act 2014 came into force on 1 September
2014. Section 100 contains a statutory responsibility to support students with
medical conditions. This means that in practice schools must make additional
arrangements for supporting students at schools with medical conditions. This
legislation does not apply to schools in Wales.
There is a concern that the rights of children and young people with medical
needs in Wales during the school day are not protected in law to the same
level as children in England, putting them at risk of an academic and health
