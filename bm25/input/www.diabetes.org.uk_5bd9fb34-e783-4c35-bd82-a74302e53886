# New drug is shown to slow Type 1 diabetes and delay diagnosis
Scientists have shown that a new treatment can slow down the immune attack
that causes Type 1 diabetes, delaying the point at which someone is diagnosed
The findings are the first to show that a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes can be
delayed in some people for a median (a way of calculating the average) of two
years. The results were announced today at the American Diabetes Association's
Scientific Sessions and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The trial was run by TrialNet – an international network of scientists
dedicated to the prevention of Type 1 diabetes – and funded by JDRF. It began
in 2011 and involved 76 people, aged 8-49 years, who didn’t yet have Type 1
diabetes but were at high risk of developing the condition in the future.
Half of the volunteers received a daily dose of a drug called Teplizumab for
14 days, and the other half received a dummy drug (known as a placebo).
72% of participants in the placebo group went on to develop Type 1 diabetes
during the course of study, compared to 43% of participants who were treated
with the drug. The median time for people in the placebo group to develop
clinical Type 1 diabetes was just over 24 months, while the median time in
The results suggest that the treatment was able to slow down the immune
system’s destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, so that
volunteers could keep on making enough of their own insulin for longer,
TrialNet scientists have previously discovered that the immune attack behind
Type 1 diabetes has different stages, and they can track these stages before
This gives us a window of opportunity to disrupt the immune attack before it
progresses too far. This way, we could protect the beta cells in order to
prevent, or at least delay, a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes.
Scientists can use blood samples to look for signs that the immune attack is
underway, suggesting that someone is at high risk of developing Type 1
diabetes in the future. People at high risk can then be placed on clinical
In this latest trial, researchers tested the drug Teplizumab: a type of
immunotherapy. Scientists have already studied Teplizumab in people recently
diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. They found that Teplizumab could exhaust the
killer immune cells responsible for the attack, so that they became less
effective at attacking the pancreas. This meant more beta cells could survive
In this latest study, the TrialNet team wanted to see if they could act even
earlier in the development of Type 1 diabetes, when the majority of someone’s

Teplizumab appeared to slow the immune system’s attack, but not stop it
entirely - which is why we saw a delay in diagnosis, rather than complete
The scientists now plan to follow the volunteers who were treated with
In those who didn’t develop Type 1 diabetes, they want to look for specific
changes in their immune system, to learn more about how the drug works and why
it might be more effective for some and not others.
In those who did develop Type 1 diabetes, the scientists also want to know if
the treatment could provide some benefits. For example, could it make their
Teplizumab is a type of drug therapy called a monoclonal antibody.
‘Monoclonal’ means that they are all copies of one type antibody, and they are
made in the laboratory. Antibodies recognise and bind to specific molecules in
the body. In the case of Teplizumab, it recognises a molecule found on T cells
called CD3. You can find out more about T cells, and the other immune cells
involved in Type 1 diabetes, on our immunotherapy spotlight page.
