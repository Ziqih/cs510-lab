Diabetes can also increase your risk of developing certain types of cancer.
Coeliac disease is a common autoimmune disease that affects 1 in 100 people,
but only 10–15 per cent are diagnosed. Gluten triggers an immune reaction in
people with coeliac disease and gluten damages the lining of the small
intestine. Other parts of the body may be affected.
Coeliac disease is more common in people who already have Type 1 diabetes, as
both are autoimmune conditions and so are genetically linked. Some people with
Type 1 diabetes find it is only after starting insulin that the symptoms of
coeliac disease become noticeable. Some people with Type 1 diabetes have a
‘silent’ form of coeliac disease, which means no symptoms are apparent and it
There is no link between coeliac disease and Type 2 diabetes.
If you think you may have coeliac disease you should:
2. Your GP can then take a simple blood test to look for an antibody made by the body in response to eating gluten
3. Your GP can refer you to a gut specialist doctor (gastroenterologist) for a simple test called a ‘gut biopsy’. Small samples of gut lining are collected and later examined under a microscope to check for abnormalities that are typical in coeliac disease.
Current clinical guidelines recommend that all children and young people with
Type 1 diabetes are screened for coeliac disease on diagnosis. It is also
recommended that adults with Type 1 diabetes are assessed for coeliac disease.
Testing should also be offered to anyone if signs and symptoms of coeliac

There are two types of thyroid disorder: hypothyroidism (where the body
doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones) and hyperthyroidism (where it
Thyroid problems are more common in people with diabetes than those without
diabetes, especially those with Type 1, because the body’s cells can attack
the thyroid and destroy the cells as they do the insulin producing cells in
the pancreas. Adults and children can be affected, and hypothyroidism is more
common in people with Type 1. People with Type 2 are more likely to develop
thyroid problems too, but it’s not clear why this is.
Neither hypo- nor hyperthyroidism can be cured, but both can be treated

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects about 5–10 per cent of women. It can
cause an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and may increase your
risk of heart disease. PCOS is associated with insulin resistance and high
levels of insulin circulating in the blood. Around 10–20 per cent of women
with PCOS will go on to develop Type 2 diabetes at some time.
PCOS is treatable but cannot be cured. Treatment options include maintaining a
healthy weight and being physically active, and the drug metformin, which is
often prescribed to people with Type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes insipidus is caused when the pituitary gland has a problem producing
the hormone vasopressin, also known as AVP, or when the action of AVP no
longer works efficiently in the kidneys. This means the body produces
increased amounts of urine because the kidneys are unable to retain water.
Diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus are separate conditions; very rarely
a patient with diabetes mellitus may also develop diabetes insipidus.

Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a skin disorder also known as
necrobiosis or NLD and can be associated with diabetes, although not
exclusively so. NLD is very uncommon, affecting only 0.3 per cent of all
people with diabetes. It most commonly occurs in young adult or early middle
age and is three times more common in women as in men. The cause is unknown
and it can happen no matter how well the diabetes is managed. NLD usually
appears as small, oval, dark red or browny yellow patches with a thick shiny
surface, which may be raised above the surrounding skin.
There is no cure, and while there are options for treatment, including
Camouflaging the condition with specialised make-up may be appropriate; see
Mastopathy is the name given to fibrous (tough) breast tissue, which can
develop in people with diabetes. Diabetic mastopathy is uncommon. It is
usually seen in women who are pre-menopausal, and who have had Type 1 diabetes
for many years. Often diabetic mastopathy is associated with other
complications of diabetes. It’s not clear what causes diabetic mastopathy, but
persistent high blood glucose levels may play a part.
If you notice any lumps or hardness in your breasts you should visit your GP
as soon as possible so that s/he can investigate the cause.
Having diabetic mastopathy does not mean that you are at increased risk of
Muscular conditions can affect anyone, but people with diabetes are at an
Limited joint mobility (also known as diabetic cheiroarthropathy) causes the
joints to lose normal flexibility. Although most common in the hands, it can
affect wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, ankles, neck and lower back, and it
is associated with microvascular complications of diabetes – nephropathy
It is treated by keeping blood glucose levels as close to target as possible,
but physiotherapy and steroid injections may also be helpful.
Frozen shoulder causes pain, stiffness and limited mobility in the shoulder.
It is more common in people who have had diabetes for a long time, are of
older age, have had a heart attack or who have the microvascular complications
of diabetes (retinopathy and nephropathy). It is treated with painkillers,
steroid injections, physiotherapy and, in some cases, surgery.
Dupuytren’s contracture causes contraction of the fingers (particularly the
ring and little finger) towards the palm so they cannot be straightened. It is
most common in people who have had diabetes for a long time, are of older age,
or have the microvascular complications of diabetes. It is generally treated
Trigger finger (also known as stenosing tenosynovitis) is a painful condition
that affects the tendons in the hand. When the finger or thumb is bent towards
the palm, the tendon gets stuck and the finger clicks or locks. It is most
common in the ring finger. It is more common in people who have had diabetes
for a long time, are of older age, or who have retinopathy or nephropathy. It
is treated with steroid injections, splinting the finger or, in some cases,
The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include pain, numbness or pins and
needles in the hand and wrist, particularly the thumb, forefinger and middle
finger. The pain (often described as a tingling or burning sensation) is often
worse at night. It is treated by splinting the wrist, steroid injections and,
Dental problems are more common in people with diabetes. It is estimated that
people with Type 2 diabetes are three times more likely to develop dental
problems than people without diabetes, and the risk is also increased for
Oral problems can occur in people with diabetes for a number of different
reasons, which is why it is especially important to visit a dentist regularly
and tell them about your diabetes. People with diabetes who have persistent
high blood glucose levels are more likely to have dental problems.

Haemochromatosis is when there’s too much iron in the blood and that can lead
to diabetes. This type of diabetes is secondary diabetes and is like Type 1.
Insulin resistance (IR) occurs when the cells of the body do not respond
properly to insulin. This means the insulin produced by the pancreas cannot be
used effectively. People with IR may need a much larger amount of insulin or
other insulin sensitising medications to reach and stay within their blood
The most common cause of IR is obesity, but some other rare conditions can
cause IR and sometimes even severe insulin resistance (SIR). Rare conditions
causing SIR include insulin receptor mutations, insulin receptor antibodies
and lipodystrophy (abnormal fat distribution). Both IR and SIR are more severe
in puberty and pregnancy and may be picked up at these times.
Whilst IR and SIR doesn’t always lead to diabetes, diabetes is a common
outcome of the condition because the pancreas is unable to produce enough
insulin and blood sugar levels rise. Despite this, it is important to
recognise that IR and SIR is not the same as diabetes. If the pancreas is able
to produce enough insulin to overcome the resistance, then diabetes does not
Weight loss, healthy eating and exercise and the medications metformin and
pioglitazone can improve IR and SIR. Some patients with SIR need specialised
concentrated insulin therapy or a combination of the three.
You can find further information and support can be found on the National
Severe Insulin Resistance Service website. They provide a multidisciplinary
service for adults and children with severe insulin resistance, lipodystrophy
or both throughout England. The service gets funding from NHS England.

Pancreatitis occurs when your pancreas, the small organ located behind your
stomach in your abdomen, becomes inflamed. This could lead to type 3c
Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin, which regulates your body’s blood
glucose (sugar) level. It also produces digestive enzymes, which help you to
There are two types of pancreatitis, acute pancreatitis and chronic
Acute pancreatitis is where your pancreas suddenly becomes inflamed over a
short period of time. Common signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis include:
You may need treatment in hospital, but you should be able to recover fully in
a few days if your condition is not severe.
If your pancreas stays inflamed over time, the cells may become permanently
damaged and stop working properly. This is called chronic pancreatitis. In
addition to the symptoms of acute pancreatitis, the common signs and symptoms
It’s important that you are aware of these symptoms so you can get the
Almost 1 in 3 people with chronic pancreatitis go on to develop type 3c
diabetes. This is because the damaged cells prevent the pancreas from
