Step Challenge on the horizon, it could be time to step out of your comfort
One million steps might sound like an awful lot. But we'll help you break that
down into manageable chunks so you can reach your goal in no time.
* You can walk anywhere, any time and it’s free.
* Walking briskly can help you build stamina, burn excess calories and make your heart healthier.
* Being active can also increase the amount of glucose (sugar) used by your muscles and so may lower blood sugar levels.
* It can help the body to use insulin more effectively.
* Walking is easy on joints and suitable for all levels of aerobic fitness.
* Walking benefits your mind, too. Walking can help reduce stress levels and symptoms of depression and anxiety. It can also improve your sleep helping you be ready to face the day.
If you want to go walking, but find you have painful joints, check whether
your local swimming pool holds exercise classes. The water helps to support
your joints while you move and ensures you still use your muscles.
While walking is considered a safe physical activity for people of all ages
and fitness levels, it’s especially important for people with diabetes to take
some precautions before they start pounding the pavements.

Foods such as a banana or other piece of fruit, a slice of malt loaf or yogurt
can make good pre-and post-walk snacks, but if you have diabetes, the amount
and type of food you will need when walking will depend on when you last ate,
how hungry you are and what is happening with your blood sugar levels.
Not everyone will need to have a snack before they walk and your nutritional
needs will also vary depending on the distance and pace of the walk.
If you’re walking for over an hour at a vigorous pace think about having a
snack during your walk. People who have Type 1 diabetes and people with
diabetes who take medications that can lower blood sugar levels (such as
sulphonylureas), should check their blood sugar levels before, during and
after their walk as it may cause your levels to drop.
Stay safe when you walk. Make sure you carry hypo treatments to use if your
blood glucose drops below 4mmol/l. Tell someone your route and make sure you
have a diabetes ID on you at all times.
