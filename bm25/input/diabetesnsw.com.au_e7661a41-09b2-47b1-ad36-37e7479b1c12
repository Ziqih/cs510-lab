Tear-testing may be the future of screening for diabetic peripheral
neuropathy, a debilitating condition that affects people with diabetes, new
The study, is the first to show that peripheral nerve damage – often the
earliest sign of the condition – can be traced in tear film.
When discussing the findings Dr Maria Markoulli, senior author of the study
said “We found that people with type 1 diabetic peripheral neuropathy – which
can result in recurring ulcers of the feet and in severe cases require
amputation – have reduced levels of a protein known as ‘substance P’ in their
“In the future, people living with type 1 diabetes may be able to have a quick
tear sample collected either at their optometrist, the chemist, GP or
endocrinologist, and be told whether they are at risk.”
Peripheral neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes and affects
almost 50% of people living with the condition. It occurs when chronically
high blood sugar damages the nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord to
Symptoms include pain, numbness, imbalance, weakness, pins and needles, and
While nerve damage cannot be reversed, early detection can help patients
better manage the condition and prevent further complications. However,
current early testing options are limited to invasive examinations, such as
Peripheral neuropathy can be very difficult to detect early on and what the
study is proposing with this method is something that can be done quickly and
The researchers tested the concentration of two proteins (called
neuropeptides) in the tear film of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes
compared to control groups. The study consisted of almost 100 participants.
While the researchers found that those with type 1 diabetic peripheral
neuropathy had less ‘substance P’ protein in their tear film, the results were
not the same for type 2 diabetes. The researchers believe this is because
there are different pathologies and risk factors for type 1 and type 2
Dr Markoulli said, “This tells us that the two disease processes are quite
different, and we are eager to expand the study to determine specific changes
While the results are promising for those with type 1 diabetes, further study
is required before tear testing becomes available clinically.
