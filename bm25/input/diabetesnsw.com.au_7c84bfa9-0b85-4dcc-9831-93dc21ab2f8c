# Blood pressure and weight put young at risk of type 2
A study from the Universities of Glasgow and Manchester, which examined known
risk factors for heart disease between people with and without type 2 diabetes
at similar ages found that younger people diagnosed with diabetes have a
greater difference in weight relative to people without the condition.
The difference in weight between those with and without type 2 diabetes was
most marked for white people, especially women. The same was also true for
blood pressure: young, white people had a higher difference in blood pressure
when diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when measured against those without the
While the work confirmed the same patterns were seen in South Asian and Black
people, these groups tended to develop type 2 diabetes at much lower BMIs,
with less difference in weight between those who did and did. Similar, though
less marked patterns by age were seen for blood fat levels.
Previous studies have shown that there is a greater loss of life from type 2
diabetes in White people, and the researchers believe these findings may help
Overall the researchers found that the difference in weight for individuals
with and without type 2 diabetes was 20kg, between the ages of 20 and 39 years
old. While for those diagnosed over 80 years old, the weight difference was
only 5kg. Similarly, the difference in blood pressure was highest in the
younger age bracket for those who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. There
was no difference in blood pressure for those with or without type 2 diabetes
People who develop diabetes at a younger age develop more complications over
their lifetime, and die younger than people who develop diabetes much later in
life. However scientists still don’t fully understand why this is case.
Researchers say these findings may explain why younger onset of type 2
diabetes could be more damaging to some individuals, as they develop it on top
Professor Naveed Sattar of the University of Glasgow, who led the study, said:
“Our findings could help explain why younger diabetes onset is more damaging,
and offer important insights into different groups for the development of type
“They also suggest a need for greater healthcare emphasis on diabetes and
heart disease management in young people developing diabetes, regardless of
Prof Martin K Rutter of The University of Manchester, and Manchester
University NHS Foundation Trust, who col-led the study, said, “Our work also
helps to understand why there may be a greater loss of life from type 2
diabetes in White people as we noted that risk factors differences between
those with and without diabetes, across nearly all ages, were less in South
Asians and Black people compared to White people
“Our study also further illustrates how South Asians and Black people are more
sensitive to the adverse metabolic effects of weight gain than Whites. These
findings may hold some relevance to the current COVID-19 findings where people
with diabetes, and of specific ethnicities, are at greater risk for severe
The researchers used the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink to identify
187,601 people with type 2 diabetes diagnosed between 1998–2015 in England.
The study compared their weight and blood pressure at diagnosis with age-
matched people without diabetes, by sex and ethnic group.
