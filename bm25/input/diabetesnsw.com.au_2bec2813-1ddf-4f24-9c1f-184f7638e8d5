The CSIRO have released trial findings involving a lower carbohydrate diet and
exercise program for people living with type 2 diabetes.
They are advocating for government funding to translate research findings into
a lifestyle modification program that can be offered to the public.
Further information on the research study can be found here.
This 12 month trial published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition
compared the benefits of two low kilojoule eating plans, in combination with
three supervised aerobic and resistance exercise sessions per week.
Participants in the trial were adults living with type 2 diabetes who were
One eating plan had lower carbohydrate, higher protein and unsaturated fats,
the other had the same kilojoules, but a more traditional ratio of
Both eating plans showed some really positive results:
The low carbohydrate diet showed some additional benefits - greater reductions
in their diabetes medication requirements, greater improvements in their blood
Previous studies have indicated that restrictive diets can be difficult to
adhere to. In this study, the participants in the low carbohydrate group had
increased their carbohydrate intake by a small amount by the end of the 12
This study provides great evidence that intensive interventions result in real
benefits for people with diabetes – and hopefully demonstrates the need to
governments for funding for such interventions on a larger scale.
It also shows some exciting potential for well-balanced lower carbohydrate
diets as one possible intervention for people with type 2 diabetes, and we
look forward to seeing further longer term studies to support this.
If you are considering adopting a reduced carbohydrate diet, we encourage you
to seek information and support from your dietitian and diabetes team, or call
