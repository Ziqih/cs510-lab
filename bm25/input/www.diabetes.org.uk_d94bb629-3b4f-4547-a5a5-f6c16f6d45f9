# Diabetes and sexual problems – in men
### Having high sugar levels for a long period of time can cause problems in
how you have sex – called sexual dysfunction.
Most people will have sexual problems at some point in their lives, whether
they have diabetes or not. And having diabetes doesn’t mean you will
automatically have a problem. But people with diabetes are more at risk of
sexual dysfunction (problems when you have sex). It's one of the complications
of diabetes, and happens because of high blood sugar levels, as well as high
Having high sugar levels for a period of time can damage your blood vessels
and nerves, including the ones that supply your penis. This can restrict the
amount of blood flowing to your sexual organs, so you can lose some sensation.
This could mean you have difficulty getting aroused, both physically and in
Sex can be an important part of our lives, but it's something we still
struggle to talk about. Getting the time and support to talk about sexual
problems with a healthcare professional is one of your 15 essential healthcare
checks. This the care and support you’re entitled to, so if you’re not getting
this type of care and you need it, don’t be afraid to ask your healthcare
Here we’ll take you through some types of sexual problems in men. This
information can help you manage any problems you may have now, or reduce your
risk of developing them in the future. And if you're looking for information
about sexual problems in women, we've got that too.
The most common type of sexual problem in men is erectile dysfunction
(sometimes known as impotence). This is when you can’t get or keep an erection
– early signs could be if you start to lose your morning erection.

There can be several reasons for this, such as limited blood flow, nerve
damage (neuropathy) and damaged blood vessels. It can also be down to
medication or just how you’re feeling at the time.
You can get treatment for this with pills like Viagra and Cialis, but talk to
your healthcare team before taking these, as they can cause heart problems.
You could also think about therapy or counselling to help you manage erectile
dysfunction. It can be a useful tool, whatever the cause of the problem. And
we've got support to help you too – you're not alone.
Diabetes is far from the only cause of erectile dysfunction, so it’s nothing
to be embarrassed about. It happens to almost every man at some point in their
life, and is also commonly caused by ageing, drugs or alcohol.
Thrush is a fungal infection and more common in women – but men can get it
It’s not a sexually transmitted infection (STI) but it can be passed on during
sex. Anyone can get it, but if you have diabetes and your sugars run high,
you’re more likely to. That’s because a lot of sugar in your urine provides a
perfect breeding ground for the bacteria that causes thrush to grow.
Thrush can cause the tip of the penis or under the foreskin to be sore or
itchy. And you might notice discharge or find it hard to pull your foreskin
back. White patches on the head of your penis is also a common symptom. If you
You can avoid getting thrush by keeping your blood sugars as close to your
target range as possible, keeping your genitals clean (but don’t use perfumed
shower gels), and avoiding tight underwear or trousers.
You’re no more likely to get an STI if you’ve got diabetes.
You might get an STI if you have sex with someone who’s got one, if you don’t
use a condom. But rest assured, diabetes doesn’t have anything to do with it.
You might not know you’ve got an STI because some of them don’t give you many
symptoms. So use protection and there’s much less chance you’ll get one. Talk
to your healthcare team if you have any questions or need advice on what kind
This is when the tubes that run from your kidneys to your bladder (urinary
tract) get infected. UTI’s aren’t sexually transmitted but having sex is one
way that gut bacteria can get into your urinary tract.
UTIs are more common in women, but men can get them too. And if your sugars
are running high, you’re more likely to get one. That’s because a lot of sugar
in your urine provides a perfect breeding ground for bacteria to grow.

You can avoid getting a UTI by keeping your blood sugar as close to your
target as you can. As well as that, drink plenty of fluids and don’t hold on
to your pee if you need to go to the toilet.

How you’re feeling can have a big impact on how you have sex too. If you’re
feeling embarrassed or worried about a sexual problem, this can be really
difficult and make you feel like you don’t want to or can’t have sex.

support. Or if you'd rather talk over the phone, our helpline is managed by
advisors with counselling skills who are ready to answer your questions or
