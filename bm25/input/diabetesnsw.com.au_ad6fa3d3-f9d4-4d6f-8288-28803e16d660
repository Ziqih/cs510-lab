People with chronic conditions like diabetes, are more likely to experience
depression and have poorer health outcomes when depression occurs.
However, a recent study has found that team-based care improved outcomes for
Researchers from Emory University, University of Washington School of
Medicine, and their colleagues in India compared a collaborative care model in
404 patients with diabetes who also showed moderate-to-severe depressive
What they found was that more than 70 percent receiving integrated team-based
care showed improvements in both their diabetes and depression.
“Too often, mental health is overlooked due to fragmented care, stigma of
psychiatric illnesses, and shortages of mental health professions,” said
“Our study showed that as depression worsens people were less likely to manage
their diabetes well. Poorly controlled diabetes can result in a range of high
risk health complications and greater mortality,” he said.
Globally, there is a shortage of psychiatrists to address the mental health
needs of people living with diabetes. Although there are effective treatments
for depression, between 76% and 85% of people in low- and middle-income
countries receive no treatment for their mental health, said researchers.
The model used in the study was adapted from a collaborative care model
developed by the late Dr. Wayne Katon, from the University of Washington,

collaborative care model has sustainable effects at two years,” said Mohan.
“This low-cost model produced impressive results both in improving depression
as well as in several metabolic parameters and can be useful in other settings
