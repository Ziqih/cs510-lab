### Here's Zena opening up about how it felt to be diagnosed with Type 2
diabetes and what helped her feel more supported.
##Coping with the emotional impact of your diabetes diagnosis
When newly diagnosed, it’s difficult to come to terms with the fact that
diabetes is a serious condition. It's lifelong for people with Type 1 diabetes
and can be lifelong for many people with Type 2 diabetes too. You are likely
to be facing what seems like an endless and daunting list of new tasks. These
might include getting to grips with new medications or coping with injecting
On top of this, you might be trying to make big lifestyle changes, like
changing the foods you eat and perhaps feeling guilty when you don’t get it
It’s perfectly normal to feel angry, shocked, numb, low and overwhelmed in the
weeks and months following your diabetes diagnosis. We also know that

important part of your emotional recovery, so don’t be tempted to rush or

Remember that everyone is different and how you and your family cope with your
diabetes diagnosis will vary. You might find that one day you feel positive
and motivated to manage your condition and the next you feel low and hopeless.
Be kind to yourself and celebrate small successes. Starting a mood diary or
journal can be a great way to keep track of your emotions and spot any links
between how you feel physically and emotionally. It’s also important to open
up to someone you can trust. You can share your diabetes peak (success) and
diabetes pit (difficulty) of the day or week with them, to help make it easier
for you to talk about how diabetes makes you feel.
As time goes on, you will adjust to your new way of life and you’ll become
more confident in your ability to cope with the demands that diabetes can
throw at you. Difficult emotions might come back at times, but if they don’t
last too long, try not worry about it. It can be hard to feel positive about
