>>>>>>> Retinopathy is an eye complication of diabetes and can lead to
blindness. Current treatments for retinopathy only address the end-stages of
the disease, when the eye is already significantly damaged. Professor Curtis
and his research team want to test a new drug that could slow or stop
>>>>>>> Current treatments for retinopathy include laser eye surgery, or an
injection into the eye containing a drug. Both of these treatments can have
side effects and they don’t always work. They’re also aimed at treating the
advanced stages of retinopathy, when significant damage has already taken
>>>>>>> Managing blood glucose levels can help to prevent the development or
progression of retinopathy, but there are currently no other treatments.
>>>>>>> Professor Tim Curtis has previously shown that diabetes causes a
chemical called ‘FDP-lysine’ to build up inside the retina (the light-
sensitive area at the back of the eye). His team has also discovered a new
drug called ‘2-HDP’ that can block this FDP-lysine build-up and help the
>>>>>>> Professor Curtis and his team are exploring whether 2-HDP could treat
early stage retinopathy. They will test 2-HDP in rats, to see if the drug can
protect the eye from the damage caused by diabetes.
>>>>>>> The researchers will monitor how well the retina is working using a
test called an electroretinogram. This involves shining a light onto the
retina to see how the cells react. They will also see if 2-HDP is able to
prevent retinopathy that has already developed from progressing any further.
>>>>>>> ### Potential benefit to people with diabetes
>>>>>>> This research could lead to the development of a new treatment to slow
or prevent the early stages of retinopathy. This could help to protect against
devastating sight loss that people with diabetes face, and reduce the need for
invasive treatments such as laser eye surgery or injections.
