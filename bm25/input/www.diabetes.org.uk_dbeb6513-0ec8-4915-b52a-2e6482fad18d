hospital treatment during this time, or just need someone to talk to. We want
you to know we are here to help.
Before we can answer this, we need to explain neuropathy as it plays an
important part in the development of Charcot foot.
Neuropathy affects your nerves, which carry messages from your brain to
different parts of your body. When you have diabetes, high blood sugar, high
blood fats and high blood pressure can damage the small blood vessels that
supply your nerves, preventing them from receiving the essential nutrients
Because of this, the nerves throughout your body can become damaged or, over
time, disappear. This means you may start to lose the sense of feeling in your
If you have neuropathy in your feet, you may not notice any damage to your
foot, such as injuries or broken bones. This means you won’t realise that you
Because of neuropathy, you’ll be able to continue walking on your affected
foot without noticing any changes or feeling pain. But as you put pressure on
your foot, the bone and joints can start to change shape. This can alter the
shape of your entire foot and put other joints at risk.
Once you have a misshapen foot, you may also be at a greater risk of
developing a foot ulcer. And in serious cases of Charcot foot, you may need to
We know amputations can be difficult to come to terms with, but the more you

Checking your feet every day can help you spot the symptoms or any unusual
changes to your foot. You may also be able to get support from your foot
Stopping smoking and keeping your blood sugar levels, blood fats and blood
pressure within your target range can also prevent Charcot foot from

If you are diagnosed with Charcot foot, there are two treatment types
Non-surgical treatment involves keeping the foot as still as possible. This
means you will not be able to put any weight on your affected foot.
To help you with this, your foot will be put in plaster cast or you will be
given a protective boot. Your footcare team may also give you a wheelchair or
crutches, as you’ll need them to move around.
The process can take several months, or longer depending on your individual
diagnosis. You may also be given custom shoes after your treatment to keep
your foot protected and prevent a foot ulcer from developing.
We know that this type of treatment may mean you have to completely change
your way of life. But keeping your foot still is really important as it will
If non-surgical treatment is not an option for you, you may need to have
surgery. Your footcare team will discuss this with you.
The type of the surgery you will need depends on your individual diagnosis,
and you may need to have more than one operation. Your doctor will be able to
talk you through this, along with the risks and benefits involved in the
Depending on the damage to your foot, you may need to have it reshaped so that
you can start to bear weight on it again over time. This type of surgery may
mean you need to have the bones and joints in your foot all moved into their
If reshaping the foot and constant rest doesn’t help, you may need an
amputation. Your diabetes team will support you through this. And we’re here
We know that this type of treatment can be worrying, but in the majority of
cases Charcot foot doesn’t have to result in surgery or an amputation.
Regularly checking your feet for the symptoms and getting treatment as soon as
possible can help to prevent these complications from developing.

coronavirus pandemic. But you should continue to go to your appointments if
