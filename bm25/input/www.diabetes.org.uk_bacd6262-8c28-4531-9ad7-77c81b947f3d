## Sugars, sugar substitutes and sweeteners: natural and artificial
If you’re living with diabetes, or even if you’re not, you might think sweet
foods are a barrier to your healthy, balanced diet. As a general rule,
everyone should be eating less sugar – but sometimes, only something sweet
If want to lose weight, or you’re trying to keep your blood glucose levels
stable, you may want to know whether artificial sweeteners could help. If you
browse around your local supermarket, you’ll see a huge range of sweeteners on
offer, so it can be baffling to know which, if any, to go for.
### So in this section we'll take you through:
Sweeteners are ingredients that are added to food to enhance sweetness. They
can be grouped in different ways: One way is to loosely group sweeteners as:
sugar or sugar substitutes.Another way to group sweeteners is whether the
One of the most useful ways of grouping sweeteners is to look at those that
have nutritive value, ie nutritive sweeteners, and those without nutritive
There are different types of nutritive sweeteners, but they all contain
carbohydrate and provide calories. They are usually referred to as ‘sugars’ or
‘added sugar’, but they can also appear in the ingredient list of food
One group of nutritive sweeteners is polyols, which are sugar alcohols, and
They can be natural or artificially produced. Polyols contain carbohydrates
and calories, but they have fewer calories and less of an effect on blood
It’s not exactly clear how the polyols should be ‘counted’ by people who are
adjusting their insulin dose according to the carbohydrate they consume, as
not all of the carbohydrate from polyols is absorbed. The amount of calories
provided by polyols varies, as the amount of carbohydrate digested or absorbed
by the body varies, depending on the type of polyol. People with diabetes
should speak to their healthcare team for individual advice about this.
Polyols are usually used in products marketed as‘diabetic’ or ‘suitable for
diabetics’and, as these products can be as high in fat and calories as
standard products, Diabetes UK and the European Commission Regulations don’t
recommend them. Consuming large amounts of polyols can have a laxative effect,
Non-nutritive sweeteners can be one way of reducing your overall carbohydrate
and calorie intake if you substitute it for nutritive sweeteners like
sugar.These are sometimes called ‘artificial sweeteners’ and are usually found
The terms ‘non-nutritive’ and ‘artificial’ sweeteners are used
There are various artificial sweeteners licensed for use in the UK. These
* aspartame, used in Canderel, Hermesetas granulated 
* saccharin, used in Hermesetas mini sweeteners 
* acesulfame potassium (acesulfame-K), used in Hermesetas Gold sweetener 
Some products are made from a combination of two artificial sweeteners. For
example, Hermesetas Gold sweetener is made from a blend of aspartame and
They can give you a burst of sweetness, while reducing your sugar and calorie
intake because they contain little or no calories or carbohydrates and don’t
Artificial sweeteners come in granules, tablets or liquid form. Most of them
can be used in cold and hot foods, but not all can be used for cooking:
* Aspartame (used in Canderel) loses some sweetness at a high temperature.
* sucralose (used in Splenda) and acesulfame-K (used in Hermesetas Gold sweetener) can be used in cooking and baking. 
Only small amounts of artificial sweeteners are needed as they are intensely
A relatively new group of non-nutritive sweeteners include naturally sourced,
calorie-free sweeteners made from the stevia plant, eg Truvia and Stevia. They
are 200–300 times sweeter than sucrose (sugar) and are heat stable, so can be
It can be confusing to group together sweeteners as the terminologies are open
to interpretation. For instance, some products from the stevia plant are
marketed as ‘natural’, even though they’re processed and refined. Yet, some of
the other products marketed as artificial sweeteners may be derived from
naturally occurring substances. For example, sucralose, which is used in
Splenda, is derived from sugar (sucrose). Whatever the name, grouping or
terminology, it’s important to ask what is in the particular sweetener and
whether the sweetener or product has carbohydrate or calories, and how that
fits into your individual goals for healthy eating.
A major question that often comes up is how safe sweeteners are. There has
been, and continues to be, some bad publicity and controversies about certain
All non-nutritive sweeteners used in foods in the EU have to undergo rigorous
safety testing before being approved by the European Commission.
Food ingredient manufacturers have to provide evidence from safety studies
* doesn’t cause any adverse effects, including cancer
* isn’t stored within the body, or metabolised into other potentially unsafe products.
### What amount of sweetener is safe to eat?
As part of the approval process for each non-nutritive sweetener, an
Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) level is set. The ADI is the estimated amount
per kilogram of body weight that a person can consume, on average, every day,
over a lifetime without risk. ADIs are set 100 times less than the smallest
amount that may cause health concerns, so it’s extremely difficult for most
people to reach the ADI. With these checks, the current levels of intake of
artificial sweeteners in the UK are safe, although people with phenylketonuria
(a rare metabolic disorder) are advised to avoid sweeteners containing
It’s a personal choice whether you decide to use sweeteners or not. If you
decide to use sweeteners, but you’re unsure, speak to your diabetes healthcare
team for individual advice, and check labels and ingredients on food
packaging, as this can help you to make informed choices.
We all know we need to eat a healthy, balanced diet that’s low in saturated
fat, sugar and salt to keep our weight, cholesterol, blood glucose and blood
pressure in check. Sugar is a type of carbohydrate and because all
carbohydrates affect blood glucose levels, reducing your sugar intake can help
to keep blood glucose levels under control. As sugar contributes no nutritive
value, apart from carbohydrates and calories, it has ‘empty calories’ and so
is not good if you’re looking to manage your weight. This doesn’t mean that
people with diabetes should have a sugar-free diet. In fact, it’s almost
impossible to have a sugar-free diet in the long term. And, it’s also worth
remembering that products labelled ‘sugar-free’ aren’t necessarily low-
