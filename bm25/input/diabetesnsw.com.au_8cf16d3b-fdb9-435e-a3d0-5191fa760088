# GDM increases risk for type 2 over decades
The risk for type 2 diabetes remains high for more than 20 years after
pregnancy for women with gestational diabetes. Whereas the risk for type 1
These are the results of a new Finnish study.
The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes is
increasing worldwide. A number of studies have shown that women with GDM are
at high risk of developing diabetes later in life.
In this latest study, out of Finland, researchers worked with 391 women who
This included 363 women who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes through
an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 28 who were treated with insulin.
The women were matched by age, parity and date of delivery with a control
The women were asked to participate in a questionnaire in 1995 and 1996,
between 1 and 11 years after their pregnancy.
The questions included details about their GDM treatment, pre-pregnancy weight
and height, progression to diabetes, time of diagnosis and medication.
A follow-up questionnaire was conducted in 2012 and 2013, when a total of 297
women with gestational diabetes and 297 matched controls participated.
In the follow-up period, more than half of the women in the gestational
diabetes group went on to develop either type 1 (5.7%) or type 2 (50.4%)
All the type 1 diabetes diagnoses occurred within 7 years of pregnancy,
whereas type 2 diabetes diagnoses increased through the end of the study. A
Only 5.5% of women in the control group developed type 2 diabetes, and none
For the women who developed type 1 diabetes, the most predictive OGTT marker
was a 2-hour glucose value at 11.9 mmol/L, which showed a sensitivity of 76.5%
For type 2 diabetes, the most predictive OGTT value was a fasting glucose at a
level of 5.1 mmol/L, which showed a sensitivity of 63.5% and specificity of
Researchers analyzed a subgroup of 48 women from the gestational diabetes
cohort who had a fasting glucose of 7 mmol/L or higher or a 2-hour glucose of
11.1 mmol/L or higher during pregnancy Of these women, 46% developed type 2
Participants who received insulin therapy for their GDM diabetes had greater
odds of receiving a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes than those who did
For women who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, only 1.2% did not have
insulin therapy for their gestational diabetes. The sensitivity of insulin
therapy to predict type 1 diabetes was 90.5% and for type 2 diabetes was
The time to a diabetes diagnosis was also longer for women who were not
The researchers said that women with gestational diabetes, especially those on
insulin treatment, should be carefully monitored for the first decade after
the pregnancy, after which the risk for type 1 diabetes becomes negligible.
However, the risk for type 2 diabetes remained and warranted an
