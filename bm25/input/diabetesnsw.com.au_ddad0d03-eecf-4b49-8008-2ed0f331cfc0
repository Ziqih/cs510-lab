# What does "No Added Sugar" actually mean?
Nowadays, there is a huge range of foods that claim to have "no added sugar",
but what does this actually mean? Does this mean they contain no carbohydrate
if any kind and therefor won't affect our blood glucose levels?
In Australia, nutrient claims like "No Added Sugar" and other food labelling
laws are regulated by the Food Standards Code. Nutrient claims can be a little
confusing, making it hard to tell which products are healthy and which aren't.
Products that have "No Added Sugar" may still contain other ingredients that
contain carbohydrates. All carbohydrates break down to sugar (glucose) when
digested, naturally causing blood glucose levels to rise.
## Here are some of the names to look out for as "added sugars" on labels:
* hexose monosaccharides and disaccharides, including dextrose, fructose, sucrose and lactose
* products derived at a sugar refinery, including brown sugar and molasses
* concentrated fruit juice (Unless the product is a beverage, in which case concentrated fruit juice isn't considered an "added sugar")
Whilst some of these ingredients may be considered more natural, they still
break down to sugar during digestion. Thy also offer few nutrients and provide
the same amount of energy, or kilojoules, as table sugar! As with anything,
it's always important to watch your portion size!
Ideally, fresh minimally processed wholefoods take preference over packaged
foods. Look for foods high in fibre and packed full of nutrition regardless of
if they have the ‘no added sugar’ claim. If you are choosing a processed snack
and it does have the ‘no added sugar’ claim make sure you double-check the
ingredient list and most importantly, the nutrition information panel to see
