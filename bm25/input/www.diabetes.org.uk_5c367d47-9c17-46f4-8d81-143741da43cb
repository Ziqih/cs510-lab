>>>>>>> ## The Top 10 research priorities for Type 1 diabetes
>>>>>>> The Top 10 research priorities for Type 1 diabetes listed below were
published in 2011, and they're available to diabetes researchers and UK

sugar levels, in people with Type 1 diabetes, with a discrete device (non-

levels need to be to reduce the risk of developing complications in people

>>>>>>> ## Have the Type 1 diabetes research priorities been addressed?
>>>>>>> Researchers around the world are working to address the research
priorities of Type 1 diabetes. Diabetes UK doesn’t have all the answers yet,
but we will be working hard to ensure that researchers and research funders
>>>>>>> The priorities of people with Type 1 diabetes are very important to
us, and we may review the current list of priorities in the next few years, to
make sure that it’s still a true reflection. We're currently supporting work
>>>>>>> ### Priority 3: Is an artificial pancreas (closed-loop system)
>>>>>>> Diabetes UK is proud to be supporting groundbreaking research aiming
to develop and testan artificial pancreas device in adults with Type 1
diabetes. Dr Roman Hovorka, at the University of Cambridge, is working to
>>>>>>> He’s evaluating its ability to improve blood glucose control at home
>>>>>>> Dr Helen Murphy, also at the University of Cambridge, is adapting the
artificial pancreas to control blood glucose levels during pregnancy. This
research could drastically reduce cases of stillbirth and mortality rates
>>>>>>> ### Priority 6: How can awareness of and prevention of hypoglycaemia
>>>>>>> During hypoglycaemia, people who are unaware of the symptoms of low
blood glucose (hypo unawareness) show changes in brain activity, suggesting
that they perceive hypos as less unpleasant than people with Type 1 diabetes
>>>>>>> We are currently funding Dr Pratik Choudhary’s work, at King’s College
London, investigating effective strategies for treating hypo unawareness in
>>>>>>> Dr Choudhary is using advanced imaging techniques to find out if the
specific brain activity can be reversed when hypos are avoided, ultimately
>>>>>>> Findings from this study could contribute to the development of
treatments for hypo unawareness, to reduce the burden of this condition on

Insulin Dependent Diabetes Trust, and had practical support from the NIHR
