The aim of insulin therapy for someone with type 1 diabetes is to mimic the
production of insulin from the pancreas in a person without diabetes.
For someone without diabetes, the pancreas produces a steady amount of insulin
over each 24 hour period, which we call basal insulin.
The pancreas also produces extra insulin when food is eaten to bring the blood
glucose levels back into the ideal range. This is referred to as the bolus
The diagram below represents the basal and bolus insulin profiles, and this
can be mimicked for someone with diabetes who is on multiple daily injections
In type 1 diabetes, the bolus insulin given at meal times and significant
snacks is a rapid acting insulin. It is given to cover the carbohydrate load
of the meals and snacks, and used to bring above target blood glucose levels
back into the target range. Ideally, it's a rapid acting insulin. The options
available in Australia are _Novorapid, Humalog, Apidra_ and _Fiasp_.
 _Novorapid, Humalog_ and _Apidra_ start working 10-20 minutes after
injecting, they have their maximum effect in 1-2 hours after injecting and
their action continues to lower blood glucose for 3 to 5 hours. They are best
 _Fiasp_ is another rapid acting insulin. In fact, it is called an ultra rapid
acting insulin as its onset is shorter at 5-15 minutes, and its peak action is
0.5-1.5 hours with a similar duration time of 3-5 hours.
It is recommended _Fiasp_ be injected just before a meal or at the time eating
As stated, the bolus dose has two components:
1. the insulin to cover the carbohydrate content of meals of snacks which is determined by an insulin to carb ratio
2. additional insulin to bring an above target blood glucose level back into the target range which is determined by an insulin sensitivity factor (also called a correction factor).
When assessing insulin doses for type 1 diabetes it is best to look at the
basal insulin first by doing basal tests. Once the basal insulin is
determined, the bolus insulin can be assessed by looking at the insulin to
carb ratios at each meal, and assessing the insulin sensitivity factor
It sounds complicated but your diabetes team can help you. In many cases they
observe if the meal insulin to carb ratios and insulin sensitivity factors are
correct from the records you bring to clinic visits.
The insulin to carb ratio is assessed by looking for patterns over several
days for each meal. For example, to asses a breakfast insulin to carb ratio,
choose a meal where the carb content of the meal is easy to count. Don’t eat
The blood glucose level before breakfast should be in the middle or upper
target range or just above it. No additional insulin should be given to
correct the blood glucose level. The insulin to carb ratio is correct if there
is a pattern over several days where the blood glucose before lunch was less
than or equal to 2mmol/L higher or lower than the pre-breakfast blood glucose
This process can then be repeated for lunch and dinner.
The insulin sensitivity factor can be assessed by looking at how the
correction dose works over time. For example, if your blood glucose level was
10mmol/L and you gave a correction dose of 1 unit of insulin, you can observe
how much 1 unit of insulin tends to lower the blood glucose.
Talk with your diabetes team for specific guidance on your insulin dosing. For
