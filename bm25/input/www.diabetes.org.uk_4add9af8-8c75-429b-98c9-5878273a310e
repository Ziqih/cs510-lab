### High levels of ketones in your blood or urine can mean you're at risk of
developing diabetic ketoacidosis. This can be life-threatening, so it's
important to be aware of your ketone level.
On this page, we'll explain what ketones are and go through how to spot the
symptoms. We'll also show you how to test for ketones using test strips, and
explain what to do if your ketone levels are high.
Ketones are a type of chemical that your liver produces when it breaks down
Your body uses ketones for energy typically during fasting, long periods of
exercise, or when you don’t have as many carbohydrates. You can have low
levels of ketones in your blood without it being a problem.
But high levels of ketones in your blood is a sign that something isn’t quite
right. You can tell if you have high levels of ketones in your blood by
checking for them. Your doctor should give you an idea of what your target
range is and what to do if you go above it.
If you treat your diabetes with insulin, your body should be using the insulin
you give it to change blood sugar into energy. But if you don’t have enough
insulin, you’ll start to use fat for energy. And when you use fat for energy
When ketones build-up in the blood, they can become acidic and lead to
something called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This can be life-threatening, so
you need to know what the symptoms of DKA are, how to check for them and how
If you have type 1 diabetes, you’re more at risk of experiencing DKA than
people with other types of diabetes. But if you have type 2 and use insulin
then you should also look out for the signs of DKA.
DKA is also common in people who have not yet been diagnosed with type 1
diabetes, especially children. So if you’re a parent and don’t know much about
diabetes then this is good for you to know as well. You can also share this
info with anyone who looks after your child, such as their teacher.
![High levels of ketones in your blood or urine can lead to diabetic
ketoacidosis \(DKA\). 23% of children are diagnosed with diabetes in DKA.
You’re most at risk of a build-up of ketones if you don’t inject enough
insulin or if you miss a dose of insulin. It’s important to know that
sometimes you need more insulin than usual and need to check for high blood
* you have had an injury or surgery
All of these times are just part of normal life and that can be a reminder
that diabetes is always there in the background. If you’re struggling to cope
with your diabetes you can have a chat with us on our helpline. We can support
you when you’re feeling down or tired with managing your diabetes.
You should do what you can to stop ketones from building up in the body.
Noticing when your body is starting to produce ketones is an important step.
You should check for ketones in your blood or urine if you notice the
* breath that smells fruity (this is the ketones on your breath)
* high blood sugar levels (this is called a hyper)
You might notice these symptoms over 24 hours, but they can come on faster
than that. If you do notice symptoms of high ketones or if you’re a parent and
you see the signs in your child, you need to act quickly.
Ketone levels rising are a sign of things happening in the body that can be
made better. Noticing the symptoms is the first step to doing that. Next you
need to check for ketones, and seek medical help if this is high.
You can check blood or urine for ketones, but the results might be different.
Checking blood for ketones will give you real-time results, just like when you
check your blood sugar. A urine check will tell you what your ketone levels
The best way to check your ketone levels is using a ketone monitor to check
your blood. The monitor works in a very similar way to a blood sugar monitor.
You’ll prick your finger using a lancing device, get the blood on to the test
strip in your monitor and wait for the result.
There are different types of ketone monitors on the market, speak to your
doctor about which one is best for you. And remember, if you have type 1
diabetes you should get a ketone monitor for free from the NHS.
It’s also worth knowing that some blood glucose monitors have ketone checking
as well. So you might not need to have two devices to check your different
To check your urine for ketones, you’ll need to have the right test strips.
You won’t need a monitor to do this, just pee on to the test strip and wait
for the colour to change. You then need to match the colour of your test strip
with a colour chart to see your ketone levels.
## What to do if you have high ketone levels
Normal blood ketone levels can be different from person to person.
If the ketone levels in your blood are high, you’re at risk of DKA. If you
suspect DKA, go to your nearest accident and emergency department straight
away because you’ll need hospital treatment. If you’re not sure whether you
need to go to hospital, call your GP or diabetes team as soon as you can.
We have a lot more information about DKA and what you can do if your ketones
levels are high. The most important thing to remember is that you shouldn’t
ignore your results. If you’re not sure what to do next, speak to someone on
our helpline or call your diabetes team. You aren’t alone with your diabetes

Ketones are produced when your body breaks down fat. This means that you might
also notice weight loss when you have high levels of ketones.
Some people follow a ketogenic diet to lose weight. This is a very low carb
diet that produces ketones in their blood. This is ketosis not DKA because it
doesn’t involve the blood being acidic. The blood becomes acidic when ketones
build up and blood glucose levels are usually high because there is no
insulin. If you’re considering a ketogenic diet then you should speak to your
