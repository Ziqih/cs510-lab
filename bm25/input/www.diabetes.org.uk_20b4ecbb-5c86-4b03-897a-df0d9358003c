>>>>>>> Assessing the potential of a medieval antibiotic to treat infected
>>>>>>> Infections in foot ulcers can be hard to treat and don’t always
respond to antibiotics. If this happens, they can result in amputations or
>>>>>>> Dr Freya Harrison wants to find new types of antibiotics that could be
used to effectively treat infections in foot ulcers. In the future, this could
improve the quality of people with diabetes’ lives and reduce the number of
>>>>>>> Antibiotic-resistant infections are an increasing problem around the
world. People with diabetes may be more vulnerable, as they can develop hard
to heal foot ulcers, which may become infected. Foot ulcers don’t always
respond well to currently available antibiotics, so there’s a real need to
>>>>>>> Most antibiotics come from natural sources and researching traditional
remedies has been successful in the past. Dr Harrison and her team have been
studying historical manuscripts to uncover new sources of antibiotics.
>>>>>>> They have discovered a remedy used in medieval England made from
garlic, onion, bile salts, and wine. They’ve found that this cocktail can kill
>>>>>>> Dr Harrison and her team want to study this remedy further, to see if
it could be used to treat foot ulcers in the future. They want to find out why
it works, when the individual components don’t have the same effect, and
identify the specific molecules responsible for killing bacteria.
>>>>>>> The researchers will use bacteria from diabetic foot ulcers and grow
them in artificial ulcers in the lab. They’ll then test the remedy against
single and mixed species of bacteria. They’ll also compare the effectiveness
of this remedy to other currently available antibiotics, and test it in mice
to see if it has the same effect in a living organism.
>>>>>>> Finally, they want to know if the remedy or its active molecules have
any side effects on the skin. If initial lab tests suggest not, they plan to
recruit healthy volunteers to test a plaster containing the remedy.
>>>>>>> ### Potential benefit to people with diabetes
>>>>>>> Successfully treating infected foot ulcers can help to avoid sepsis
and amputations in people with diabetes. This project could help to find new
treatments that can be used to treat persistent foot ulcer infections.
>>>>>>> If successful, the findings could lead to a clinical trial.
