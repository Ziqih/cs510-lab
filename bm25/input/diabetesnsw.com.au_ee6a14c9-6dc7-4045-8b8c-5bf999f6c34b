Macular disease is the leading cause of blindness in Australia. Two of the
most common diseases affecting the macula include diabetes-related eye disease
(such as diabetic retinopathy) and age-related macular degeneration.
Despite macular disease being the leading cause of blindness in Australia, a
YouGov Galaxy study commissioned by Macular Disease Foundation Australia,
indicates that **91 per cent of Australians are unsure or unaware of the
One of the most common diseases affecting the macula, diabetes-related eye
disease is the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-aged
Australians. Yet, alarmingly, the study shows that **64 per cent of those
diagnosed with diabetes are unaware that the eyes can be affected by
Ms Dee Hopkins, Chief Executive Officer of Macular Disease Foundation
Australia, says the findings of this study are concerning.
Ms Hopkins says, “With the prevalence of diabetes in Australia expected to
grow significantly, ensuring that diabetes-related eye disease is prevented
has never been more vital. As the national peak body for macular disease in
Australia, we are working to change the behaviour of those at risk of
diabetes-related eye disease, as we have done with great success for people
with or at risk of age-related macular degeneration – to ultimately save
“Everyone with diabetes is at risk of developing vision loss from diabetes-
related retinopathy[2] and should have their eyes tested every two years. If
diabetic retinopathy has been detected, the individual should have their eyes
checked at least once a year. It may be that more frequent examinations are
Professor Greg Johnson, CEO of Diabetes Australia agrees that the study
findings are concerning, particularly given the prevalence of diabetes in
“Around 1.7 million Australians are currently living with diabetes.
Approximately 1.2 million know they have the condition, while an estimated
500,000 people are living with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes.[3] Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander people are up to four times more likely than non-
“Of the 1.2 million people who have been diagnosed, more than 300,000 (between
25 and 35 per cent) have some degree of diabetic retinopathy, and about 65,000
“It is also important for people at risk of type 2 diabetes to get their eyes
checked. For some people, a visit to the optometrist or ophthalmologist could
be the first time a health professional notices the signs of type 2 diabetes,”
Ms Hopkins says, “Many macular diseases can often be effectively managed if
detected early, and most vision loss from diabetic eye disease is preventable.
The key is eye-health management and risk reduction. Encouraging patients to
make an appointment with an optometrist for a comprehensive eye exam,
including a macula check, is an important first step.
“No matter what age, if people experience sudden changes in their vision they
“We all have an important role to play in helping patients to recognise the
risks and manage macular health. With greater information from their health
care professional, as well as help to access the right services and resources,
professionals can ensure their patients have the best possible macular health
While the study showed that there has been improvement in the number of people
having their macula checked, when it comes to reducing the risk of macular
disease, the study also shows that, **almost a quarter (23 per cent) of
Australians aged 50 and over don’t know what to do to reduce the risk of
According to Macular Disease Foundation Australia, there are some steps that
can reduce the risk of macular disease. These include:
* Regularly have a comprehensive eye test and ask about your macula,
Ms Hopkins says, “Knowledge is definitely power in the defence against macular
disease, so it’s imperative that Australians learn what they can do to
“During Macula Month, we hope that people think about their macula health;
learn the risk factors associated with macular disease; have a regular,
comprehensive eye examination and ask about their macula.”
