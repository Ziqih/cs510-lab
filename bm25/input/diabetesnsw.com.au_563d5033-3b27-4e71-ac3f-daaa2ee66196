150g (4½ ounces) snow peas, sliced thinly lengthways
1 small fresh red thai chilli, sliced thinly
2. Cook the curry paste in a small non-stick frying pan, stirring, for 2 minutes or until fragrant. Remove pan from heat. Stir in coconut milk; cool.
3. Place a large piece of extra wide foil on the kitchen bench and top with a slightly smaller sheet of baking paper, ensuring that both are larger than the fish in length. Rinse the fish under cold water and pat dry with paper towel. Using a sharp knife, make 4 deep diagonal slashes across the flesh on both sides.
4. Rub curry mixture over both sides of the fish. Place lime leaves and half the sliced lime in the fish cavity.
5. Place fish on the baking paper. Cover with another piece of baking paper and foil; scrunching the edges together to seal. Carefully lift parcel onto a large oven tray. Bake for 45 minutes or until just cooked through.
6. Meanwhile, cook rice according to packet directions. Add linseeds; mix well.
8. Carefully open fish parcel. Place under a hot grill for 5 minutes or until browned.
9. To serve, divide fish onto four serving plates; spoon over mango topping. Accompany with remaining lime slices and a quarter of the rice mixture each.
10. Mango topping Place snow peas in a heatproof bowl; pour over boiling water, stand for 30 seconds. Drain; rinse under cold water. Drain well. Combine snow peas with remaining ingredients in a small bowl.
To test if the fish is cooked, insert a knife into the thickest part – the
flesh should flake easily and no longer be translucent.
