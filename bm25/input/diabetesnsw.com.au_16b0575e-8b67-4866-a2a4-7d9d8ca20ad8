Researchers at the University of Plymouth and Nestlé have revealed new
insights into the factors that predispose children to developing What is type
The findings have emerged from a unique study, EarlyBird, that followed 300
healthy children in Plymouth, UK, for 15 years to determine who would become
at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and why.
The EarlyBird researchers monitored the children from five years of age to
early adulthood to explore how the metabolism changes during growth. The
findings, appearing in a series of peer-reviewed scientific publications, have
shed new light on the biological and physiological factors that are relevant
The latest results, published in _Diabetes Care_ (doi: 10.2337/dc19-0806),
show that the earliest event leading to pre-diabetes (the earliest signs of
diabetes) is dysfunction of the pancreatic beta-cell, independent of body
Beta-cells in the pancreas produce insulin, the hormone that regulates blood
The study also showed that this beta-cell dysfunction was associated with the
presence of genetic factors previously associated with type 2 diabetes in

Jon Pinkney, Professor of Endocrinology and Diabetes in the University of
Plymouth's Peninsula Medical School and Honorary Consultant Physician in
Endocrinology and Diabetes at University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust said:
"The rapidly rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes is one of the biggest global
health challenges, and there is an urgent need to develop effective strategies
"The research partnership between University of Plymouth and Nestlé has shown
how the risks of future type 2 diabetes can be predicted in childhood. This
opens up the possibility of individualised advice and early intervention to
reduce the risks of future type 2 diabetes".
"In this study we show that beta-cell dysfunction is an early event in the
onset of pre-diabetes in children and that this effect is body weight
independent", said François-Pierre Martin, an expert in metabolism who led the
"However, we also report in this study that subsequent weight gain during
puberty aggravates the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes. This
stresses the importance of lifestyle and nutritional interventions in
childhood to reduce the risks to develop diabetes."
Jörg Hager, a genetics expert at Nestlé Research who designed the genetic part
of the study said: " _Our research has important implications for potentially
identifying children at risk of developing pre-diabetes through genetic
markers. The new findings will allow us to develop new nutritional approaches
that target the insulin response to a meal, and the body 's ability to
Begun in the early 2000s, when the obesity epidemic was still in its infancy
and the idea that children could develop type 2 diabetes almost unheard of,
EarlyBird was able to develop strong relationships between families and
researchers and retain a high proportion of children over the course of the
The detailed metabolomic and genetic data collected over such a long period of
childhood are unique. As a consequence, researchers have been able to make a
number of vital discoveries about the relationships between lifestyle,
