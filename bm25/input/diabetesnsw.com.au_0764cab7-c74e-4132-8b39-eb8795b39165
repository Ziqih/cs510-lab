# When Age is More Than a Number
In 2017, over one in seven Australians were aged 65 or over. As you age, your
risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its complications increases and how you
manage diabetes can become more complex. You may even have other health issues
that you need medications for that affect your diabetes management. It's easy
to feel overwhelmed but there are a variety of support services available that
can help, plus a range of alternative medications that may work better for you
When you’re first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, your blood glucose levels
can often be maintained at normal levels through lifestyle changes and/or one
or more oral glucose lowering medications, although insulin may eventually be
Diabetes can result in many short- and long- term health conditions, including
heart attack and stroke, kidney damage, vision loss, nerve damage, and slow
wound healing (which can lead to lower limb amputation). These complications
are largely preventable, but early diagnosis and management of your blood
glucose levels is important to prevent, delay or slow their progression.
Looking after type 2 diabetes if you are older and using other medications is
more complex. For older people, the benefits of intensive glucose control
needs to be weighed against associated risks, such as the impact of
medications on the kidneys and the risk of interaction with other medicines
If, when, or how often you **check your blood glucose levels** depends on your
needs, and is ideally decided with your diabetes healthcare team. This will
depend on your health status, other conditions you’re living with, blood
glucose targets, current medicines, and your quality of life.
All glucose-lowering **medications** , like any other medications, have side
effects. Having routine blood tests will uncover any kidney, liver, or other
issues. This will inform your doctor as to the medicines that are safe for you
to use to manage your blood glucose levels, and prevent or delay long-term
If you’re experiencing side effects such as low blood glucose levels, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhoea, or changes in your appetite or body weight, speak with
your doctor to discuss alternative medications. There’s never been so many
Speak with your doctor (and ask for a referral to a dietitian) if you lose
your appetite or have problems with your mouth, teeth or swallowing. Losing
weight as you age can do more harm than good. If you lose muscle, it can
affect your ability to move around and increase your risk of falls.
Exercise is good for everyone, especially older people. Remember to obtain
medical clearance if you’re new to exercise. It may seem difficult, but with
the help of an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist, you can start, or
Looking after your emotional wellbeing is as important to maintain as you age
as any other time of your life. If you live with diabetes you’re more likely
to develop depression/anxiety, and vice versa. Unfortunately, anxiety tends to
be viewed as a weakness in character by some, rather than a health problem. If
you’re feeling down for more than a few days, don’t hesitate to speak with
your doctor. Anxiety and depression are like any other health condition, the
sooner they’re diagnosed, and the quicker they’re treated, the less likely
they will affect the quality of your life. This means you’ll be back to living
your life and managing your diabetes in no time at all.

This booklet provides information about healthy eating and food choices for
older people living with diabetes. As we get older, staying nourished and
maintaining healthy eating habits can be challenging. Our lifestyles and
appetites can change and chronic conditions such as diabetes can take up our
time and energy, and affect our food choices.
It is not always easy to find your way around the health system. You need to
work out who can help you with health issues and maintaining your wellbeing.
Also, as you get older you may have more health issues to deal with, which can
add extra challenges. This booklet is designed to help you understand the
health system and make it easier for you to manage your diabetes.
Diabetes care is generally the same no matter how old you are. However, there
are some specific changes that happen with age and these might affect your
diabetes. You may have had diabetes for a long time, and in your later years
you could have other health issues. This booklet gives you information to help
you manage your diabetes as you grow older.
