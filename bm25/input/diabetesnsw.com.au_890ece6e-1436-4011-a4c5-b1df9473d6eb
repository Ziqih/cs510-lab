Summer is the season when we traditionally fire up the BBQ and enjoy fun times
and celebrations outdoors. While the traditional BBQ menu generally includes a
lot of meat there are ways to add healthy flavour to the menu , boost your
veggie intake and reduce excess salt, sugar and saturated fats.
When it’s too hot in the kitchen take the cooking outside! Tenderise your meat
by marinating it in a little balsamic vinegar or pineapple juice and add
flavour with chopped fresh herbs like rosemary or thyme.
Instead of a truckload of tomato sauce on your barbequed meat use a homemade
freshly cooked sauce of tomato and onion with a grind of pepper, or top your
steak with a large barbequed mushroom drizzled with a teaspoon of olive oil
You could also try grilling fruits and vegetables such as mango, peach or
avocado on the barbecue. The natural sugars in the fruit will caramelise when
cooked, adding flavour and sweetness. The avocado adds fibre and heart-healthy

Fresh seasonal produce can make all the difference when it comes to making a
delicious salad. By choosing fruits and vegetables that are in season, you’ll
help your waistline, your wallet and the environment! Best picks for the
summer months include fresh berries, mango, nectarines, peaches, Asian greens,
Salads can be as simple or as complicated as you want; they can be an
accompaniment or a whole meal. For a whole meal start with a carbohydrate –
potato, rice, couscous, pumpkin or sourdough bread, cubed and toasted, for a
base - and add some protein like lentils, three bean mix, or shredded cooked
chicken. Mix in some greens such as baby spinach leaves, broccoli florets,
sliced cabbage or mixed lettuce leaves (mesclun) and add some texture with
tomato wedges, cucumber slices, grated carrot, nuts, seeds or crumbled feta.
Add one or more herbs – chopped mint, parsley, coriander, chilli, garlic, or
ginger. After tossing your salad try a drizzle of lime juice or balsamic
vinegar, mix it with a tablespoon of a extra virgin olive oil or macadamia nut
 _Recipe idea: Roast some butternut pumpkin, squash and zucchini. Toss with
baby spinach, toasted pine-nuts and a splash of balsamic vinegar._
Salad dressings can have a lot of energy (kilojoules) even if eaten in small
amounts, so it’s important to watch your portion size. When choosing oils for
salad dressings, cold-pressed nut and seed oils, such as olive and canola
oils, are the healthiest choices. Coconut and palm oil are high in saturated
fat and not recommended. Make your own dressings using cold-pressed seed and
nut oils, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, vinegar, fresh herbs and spices.
Recipe idea: Everyone loves a Caesar salad dressing but it’s traditionally
high in fat and salt. For a healthier, yet just as tasty, version mix low-fat
natural yoghurt, Dijon mustard, anchovies, white wine vinegar and a pinch of
There’s been a lot in the media about sugar – so most people know a little is
okay but a lot is not so good. If you use sugar, then try using less. Instead
of icing a cake try dusting it with icing sugar. Instead of shop bought sweet
and sour sauce use a generous squeeze of lime juice and some chopped fresh
mango and red chilli. You’ll be getting the sweet and the sour without all the

Salt is often added to pre-prepared foods so try not to add extra salt to your
food. You’ll find it can open a whole world of flavour you didn’t know existed
as salt masks the flavours of other foods. It also counteracts the sweetness
of foods, so by not adding salt you can use less sugar in recipes. If you do
use high salt ingredients, choose the reduced salt varieties or use less of
