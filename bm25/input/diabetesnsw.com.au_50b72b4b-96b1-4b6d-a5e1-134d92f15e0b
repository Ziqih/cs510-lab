# Pros and cons of low carb, high protein with type 1
A low carb, high protein diet refers to restricting your carbohydrate (carb)
intake while increasing your protein intake, predominately through animal
proteins, eg red and white meat, seafood and eggs.
Its aim is to achieve your daily nutrient, health management and/or weight
These types of diets generally focus on limiting refined carbohydrate rich
foods and drinks such as high carb processed and packaged foods eg chips,
biscuits, cakes, pastries, lollies, ice cream, and sugar-sweetened drinks
including soft drinks, cordials, energy and sports drinks, and flavoured milk.
However, in most cases low carb, high protein diets also restrict nutritious
carb-rich foods from the five core food groups such as:
1. Wholegrains and wholegrain products: breads, cereals, pasta
These foods are full of beneficial nutrients such as fibre, vitamins,
There is not one low carb, high protein diet or standardised approach but
instead many variations. Generally, a low carb diet refers to less than 26%
total energy from carbohydrates per day while a moderate carb diet is between
The Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend between 45-65%, which is
considered a moderate to higher carbohydrate diet, which most largely plant
based eating styles are. So what does that look like in grams per day?
A low carb diet would contain less than 130g carbohydrates per day for someone
following a diet of 8,400kJ (2000 calories). A moderate carbohydrate diet
would contain 130-225g carbohydrates per day. In terms of protein, a higher
protein diet can range from around 1-1.5g per kg of total body weight.
There are various low carb diets in the media such as Ketogenic (Keto),
Atkins, Paleo and Optifast, although each of them follow slightly different
rules. Some diets may focus on quality, nutrient-rich carbohydrate food
choices, while others may focus purely on the amount of carbohydrates eaten.
A common theme of low carb diets is an initial success in weight loss and
improved post prandial (after eating) blood glucose levels. Seeing these
results in the first few weeks can boost confidence levels and lead to
Initial weight loss and improvements in blood glucose levels may result from
Most likely, it is due to the reduced intake of food, energy (calories) from
processed carbohydrates, drinks, fast foods, snacks and condiments required
when following a low carb diet. This is usually followed by a focus on various
‘no or low carb’ vegetables, healthier fats (eg avocado, olive oil, nuts and
Of course, with only 6-8% of Australians reaching their recommended vegetable
intake, a focus on eating more vegetables is positive. However, it doesn’t
necessarily mean that you would need to follow a low carb, high protein diet
Research has shown that a low carb, high protein diet is no more effective
than enjoying a healthy, balanced eating pattern at achieving blood glucose
levels improvement and body weight goals, especially in the long term.
Despite early desired outcomes to body weight and blood glucose levels,
evidence suggests that in the long run results are similar to that of a
Often when people stop losing weight, they start to lose confidence and can
find it hard to stick to a diet.
When this is paired with the restrictions of very little carb-rich foods
and/or other impacts such as gut problems or lacking key nutrients, many
Choosing a low carb, high protein diet can carry benefits such as increasing
your vegetable intake but it can also be lacking in certain areas.
Many foods that may be restricted such as wholegrains and carb-containing
vegetables including legumes, as well as dairy and fruit, provide a range of
These nutrients include fibre, vitamin C, folate, thiamine, magnesium and
potassium. Restriction of the above foods and or food groups, without
supplementation and or monitoring, can result in poor health outcomes, eg,
Some low carb, high protein diets may not distinguish between different types
of fats and which to include. This might mean you end up adding in foods, in
particular red and white meat, which contain saturated fat. Eating a lot of
saturated fat (ie solid fat at room temperature) may heighten your risk of
blood vessel damage and heart disease. It may also increase the possibility of
Overall, there is no strong evidence that a low carb, high protein diet will
provide benefits to your health compared to alternative diets.
There also isn’t enough research to determine how safe this diet is in the
As with health and nutrition, there really isn’t any ‘one size fits all’
approach. While some people may find a low carb, high protein diet useful in
managing their diabetes in the short term, there are a variety of alternative
With studies showing that 95-98% of dieters return to their pre-diet results
after a longer period of time, the importance of an eating pattern that suits
your needs and lifestyle is key. People who wish to follow a low carb diet
should do so in consultation with their diabetes health care team, including
Also, due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia (very low blood glucose
levels), checking your blood glucose levels regularly and speaking with your
doctor about any adjustments to your diabetes medication is very important,
particularly if you require insulin to manage your diabetes.
A low carb diet is not recommended for children, pregnant or breastfeeding
women, unwell older people or people with certain medical conditions or
histories. Also, following a very low carbohydrate diet, such as a ketogenic
diet, is not recommended due to the increased risk of ketones.
