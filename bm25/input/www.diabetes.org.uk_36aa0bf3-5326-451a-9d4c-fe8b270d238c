Please view Whisk.com privacy policy for more information
good handful fresh herbs (rosemary and thyme are ideal)
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4.
2. Place the chicken onto a rack and place over a roasting tin. Squeeze the lemon over the bird and place the lemon shells in the cavity of the bird.
3. Place some of the herbs on top of the bird and place the remaining herbs into the cavity. Season with black pepper.
4. Pour the water into the roasting tin, then place in the oven and cook for 45 minutes per kilo, plus 20 minutes (1 hour and 50 minutes for a 2kg bird), topping up the water if necessary.
5. Take out of the oven, cover with foil and allow to stand for 15 minutes.
6. Remove the skin, carve, and serve with plenty of vegetables and potatoes.
* To check if the chicken is cooked, pierce the skin between the thigh and breast – the juices should be clear.
* If using the pan juices to make gravy, pour into a jug and allow to stand for a few minutes. The fat will float to the top and can be removed with a spoon before making the gravy.
* Freezing instructions: Suitable for freezing once cooked. For convinience, you can freeze this dish in portions, then defrost in the fridge or microwave and reheat thoroughly until piping hot throughout.
This makes a great packed lunch on warm summer days.
Serve this dish with plenty of rice or naan to mop up the delicious juices.
A tasty alternative to a lunchtime sandwich; tastes even better if left
overnight in a fridge to allow flavours to intensify.
