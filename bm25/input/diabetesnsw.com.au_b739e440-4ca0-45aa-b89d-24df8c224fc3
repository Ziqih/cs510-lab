# Study looks at impact of artificial sweeteners on children
Artificial sweeteners are a growing part of our diets and in the US are now
consumed by at least one in four children.
A policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics, is recommending
future research into how they affect children's weight, taste preferences, the
risk for type 2 diabetes, and long-term safety.
Carissa Baker-Smith, from the University of Maryland, School of Medicine, said
"Looking at the evidence, we found there's still a lot to learn about the
impact of artificial sweeteners on children's health. Considering how
regularly artificial sweeteners are now consumed as part of our diet, we need
more research into the use of sweeteners and the risk for obesity and type 2
Artificial sweeteners were introduced into the food supply more than 60 years
ago to mimic the taste of sugar without adding calories.
When they were first introduced, health concerns focused on a potential risk
of cancer, which was not borne out in subsequent research. Health concerns
around these products have now shifted. Rising levels of obesity have
increased use of these products, and attention is directed at conflicting
evidence over whether these sweeteners actually help control weight.
The majority of short-term studies suggest that substituting artificial
sweeteners for sugar may reduce weight gain and promote small amounts of
weight loss in children. However, data is limited.
There is also research suggesting links between the use of artificial
sweeteners and changes in appetite and taste preferences, as well as in the
gut microbiome, which may affect blood glucose levels and lead to metabolic
syndrome, insulin resistance, diabetes, and weight gain. But findings remain
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that food and beverage
manufacturers report sweetener content on food and beverage labels, rather
than just listing them among ingredients, since they are now so widely
"It is currently hard to know how much non-nutritive sweetener is in a product
since manufacturers aren't required to specify," Dr Baker-Smith said.
"Listing the amount of non-nutritive sweetener a product contains would help
families and researchers understand how much is actually being consumed by
individuals and populations and further evaluate potentially related health
Research suggests many parents in the US aren't aware their child is consuming
these products. One study found that only 23 per cent of parents can correctly
In addition, 53 per cent of parents said they seek items labeled as "reduced
sugar," but most did not recognize that the sweet taste was instead being
Knowing the amounts of sweeteners in products would also help ensure
children's consumption remains below acceptable daily intake levels, Dr Baker-
