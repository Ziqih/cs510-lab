professionals supporting adults with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes
>>>>>>> ### ​This guide is for healthcare professionals working with people
with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes who are experiencing emotional difficulties.
It offers strategies and tools for how to recognise and have conversations
about emotional problems, as well as for providing appropriate support.
>>>>>>> This guide was originally developed by the Australian Centre for
Behavioural Research in Diabetes (ACBRD), the National Diabetes Services
Scheme (NDSS) and Diabetes Australia in 2016, which is available to download
from the NDSS website. The UK edition (2019) of these guidelines were produced

>>>>>>> Diabetes self-management is demanding and complex. Activities such as
monitoring blood glucose, injecting insulin, taking oral medications, regular
physical activity, and healthy eating all require a comprehensive
understanding of diabetes, as well as healthy coping, and skills in problem-
solving and risk reduction. Diabetes is more than a physical health condition,
it has behavioural, psychological, and social impacts, and demands high levels
of self-efficacy, resilience, perceived control, and empowerment. Thus, it is
unsurprising that living with diabetes negatively impacts upon the emotional
well-being and quality of life of many people living with the condition.
>>>>>>> Emotional and mental health problems (collectively referred to as
psychological problems from here on), such as diabetes distress and
depression, are common among adults with diabetes and are associated with sub-
life, and increased health care costs. As noted by Jones and colleagues:
‘maintaining or achieving good psychological well-being and quality of life is
an important outcome of diabetes care in its own right.’ This sentiment is
shared by people with diabetes and health professionals, who recognise
emotional health to be an important component of standard diabetes care.
>>>>>>> ‘We must move beyond the tendency to place an artificial divide
between the emotional and the physical aspects of diabetes management that can
lead to labelling the emotional aspects of diabetes a pathological condition.
The two are so intertwined and interrelated that simply calling the emotional
side a co-morbidity is counterproductive.’(Lawrence Fisher, Jeffrey Gonzalez
>>>>>>> Given that separating psychological care from the context of diabetes
self-management is rarely easy nor desirable, there is a strong argument that
basic psychological care needs to be incorporated into diabetes care pathways,
including assessment and treatment of the psychological problems frequently
faced by people with diabetes. International guidelines reflect this view;
recommending awareness and assessment of psychological problems in diabetes
>Furthermore, the need for mental health care for people with diabetes is
> acknowledged in many of the UK National Diabetes Strategies, although often
>>>>>>> Despite the numerous guidelines, and recognition by health
professionals and Governments, the emotional and mental health needs of people
with diabetes are often undetected and unmet in clinical practice.
Furthermore, there is little evidence to demonstrate significant progress in
the implementation of such recommendations. Health professionals cite lack of
skills, confidence, time, and limited access to practical resources as common
barriers. Whilst existing guidelines acknowledge the importance of
psychological problems in diabetes and some make recommendations for assessing
them, most fall short in providing guidance about how to incorporate this into
the daily clinical practice setting. This guide is designed to complement and

diabetes, and communicate findings to other team members where appropriate.”

>>>>>>> This guide is an evidence-based, clinically informed, practical
resource to support health professionals in meeting the emotional and mental
health needs of adults with diabetes. While the guide is informed by evidence,
it is not an evidence-based guideline. As recommendations for routine
monitoring of emotional well-being have existed in guidelines for 25 years,17
there is little evidence that producing yet another guideline would benefit
>>>>>>> The original Australian edition (2016) of the handbook, on which the
UK practical guide (2019) is based, was developed by a team with expertise in
psychology and diabetes. Their work has been overseen by a multidisciplinary
Expert Reference Group. The guidelines were also peer-reviewed by academic and
clinical experts with relevant expertise, and by end users (people with
diabetes and health professionals). We acknowledge all those involved in the
>>>>>>> This guide is expected to support health professionals working with
adults with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.
>>>>>>> In many instances it is appropriate to refer to Type 1 and Type 2
diabetes separately. However, for readability purposes, and because research
studies often do not separate the two types, we refer to people with diabetes
collectively in many parts of the guide. Where a research study has
definitively specified the type of diabetes, we have also made the

specialist and primary care nurses, dietitians, diabetologists, and other
health professionals supporting adults with diabetes. Mental health
and social workers may also find this guide to be a useful resource.

specifically with adults with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, in the context of the

>>>>>>> * Children and adolescents with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes,
as the advice may not be appropriate to their developmental stage.
>>>>>>> * Adults with other types of diabetes (e.g. gestational,
MODY, LADA). It may be appropriate to apply parts of this guide but we advise
you to use your professional judgement before doing so.
>>>>>>> * People with language, cultural, cognitive, health
literacy, or other barriers. It is beyond the scope of this guide to provide
specific recommendations for each of these diverse groups, and for many groups
the evidence base relating to mental health and diabetes is sparse. Where
relevant resources exist these are noted in the chapter. In the absence of
evidence specific to these groups, it may be reasonable to extrapolate from
>>>>>>> Furthermore, we emphasise the importance of tailoring your approach to
the needs of the person – this applies to all people with diabetes, not just
those from diverse groups. Throughout this guide, we make suggestions for
words you might say, or strategies you might use to address psychological
problems. Be guided by the suggestions but avoid using them as a checklist.
Reflect upon how relevant the suggestion is for each individual, and tailor
>>>>>>> #### What are the expected outcomes of the guide?
>>>>>>> The overall purpose of this guide is to enhance opportunities for
people with diabetes to talk about their emotional well-being with their
health professionals and, if problems are present, to identify and address
these. This conversation informs a shared decision about appropriate
management strategies. It is an important and positive step toward holistic
>>>>>>> * Health professionals will feel supported, confident and
skilled to: ‘have the conversation’ about emotional and mental health
generally or, specifically, how diabetes is impacting upon the person’s
emotional well-being, address psychological problems that are within their
skillset and remit, and make referrals to specialist care providers, as needed
>>>>>>> * People with diabetes will appreciate that their health
professionals ask about how diabetes is impacting upon their emotional well-
being, and that they are offered support to address identified psychological
>>>>>>> * Health professionals and health services will approach
psychological problems in diabetes in a consistent and systematic way.
>>>>>>> * Emotional and mental health will be integrated into
routine diabetes consultations as part of ‘usual care’.
>>>>>>> * People with diabetes will be active participants in a
person-centred approach to care for their psychological problems.

health professional, but most work in teams rather than in isolation. We
recognise that the service, practice or department you work in may influence
your capacity to implement the practices recommended in this guide. However:

with diabetes. The symbols indicate an approximate proportion of people with
diabetes who might be expected to be experiencing the emotional problem (e.g.
one in five adults with insulin-treated Type 2 diabetes experience diabetes
distress). Underneath the symbols are descriptions of the population to whom
the statistic applies. Typically, this refers to three groups: people with
Type 1 diabetes, people with Type 2 diabetes who use insulin, and people with
Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin. These estimates are based on the best
evidence available. Keep in mind that your own clinic population may vary from
the study population in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics.
