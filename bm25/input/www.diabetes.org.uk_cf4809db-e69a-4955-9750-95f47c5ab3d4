on your blood sugar levels and your own preference.

Everyone had glucose (sugar) in their blood, but if your blood sugar levels

meals, one hour after meals and also at bed time.

Insulin is a hormone that allows glucose (sugar) – the body’s main fuel – to
enter the cells and to be used for energy.
