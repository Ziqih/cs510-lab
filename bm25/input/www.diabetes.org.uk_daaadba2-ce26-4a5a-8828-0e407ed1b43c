They may often ask many detailed questions about the ‘what’, ‘how much’ and
It's natural to feel a bit scrutinised by this attention, and perhaps even
guarded. The intentions of even the most well meaning health professional can

your mindset following diagnosis so you can feel more equipped to face the
Food is such a pleasure, and life with diabetes doesn’t mean the end of this.
The difficulty is that in our food-abundant environments there are over 30+
reasons why we eat, and hunger is just one of them.
We often beat ourselves up for not being able to stick to our healthy eating
plans, but traditional advice tends to assume that we are only eating when
All of us - with or without diabetes, and of all shapes and sizes - know that

If you’re someone who tends to beat yourself up for getting off track, I

food choices – if you make a less-than-perfect choice, how can you keep it in
perspective, and is there anything you can learn and try differently for next
## Practical ideas to give yourself the best chance
