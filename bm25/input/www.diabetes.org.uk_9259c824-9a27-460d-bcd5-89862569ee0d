### High blood sugar levels can seriously damage parts of your body, including
your feet and your eyes. These are called the complications of diabetes. But
you can take action to prevent or delay many of these problems.
You might hear your healthcare team talk about two types of diabetes
complications: serious ones that build up over time called chronic
complications and ones that can happen at any time called acute complications.
These are long-term problems that can develop gradually, and can lead to
serious damage if they go unchecked and untreated.
Some people with diabetes develop an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy
which can affect their eyesight. If retinopathy is picked up – usually from an
eye screening test - it can be treated and sight loss prevented.
Having diabetes means that you’re more at risk of serious foot problems and
which can lead to amputation if untreated. Nerve damage can affect the feeling
in your feet and raised blood sugar can damage the circulation, making it
slower for sores and cuts to heal. That’s why it’s important to tell your GP
if you notice any change in how your feet look or feel.
When you have diabetes, high blood sugar for a period of time can damage your
blood vessels. This can sometimes lead to heart attacks and strokes.

blood sugar levels and high blood pressure. It is known as diabetic

blood sugar levels. This can make it harder for the nerves to carry messages
between the brain and every part of our body so it can affect how we see,

damages your gums. The blood vessels in your gums can also become damaged,

High sugar levels in your blood over a long period of time can seriously
damage your blood vessels. If your blood vessels aren’t working properly,
blood can’t travel to the parts of your body it needs to. This means your
nerves won’t work properly either and means you lose feeling in parts of your
body. Once you’ve damaged the blood vessels and nerves in one part of your
body, you’re more likely to develop similar problems in other parts of your
body. So if your feet are damaged, serious heart problems can follow.

thing you can do if you have diabetes because smoking makes it even harder for
Keeping a close eye on these levels and understanding your numbers will help
you take control of your health. We know it’s not always as simple as that,
When you have one chronic complication, you’re much more at risk of developing
other complications. So if your blood vessels are damaged in your feet for
example, the damage can happen to other parts of your body like your kidneys
and heart too. This means you need to stay on top of your health checks and
blood sugar levels when you’re managing other problems.
