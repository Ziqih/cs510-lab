Long gone are the days of receiving milk fresh from the cow delivered in a
glass bottle to your door, now there is a huge array of options to choose
Milk and other dairy products are an important source of highly absorbable and
readily available calcium. It is an important source of other key nutrients
including protein, iodine, vitamin A, vitamin D, riboflavin, B12 and zinc,
which are all important for good health. Milk is also a source of healthy, low
glycaemic index carbohydrates that are important for energy.
With so many non-dairy alternatives available now it is easier than ever for
people with allergies, intolerances or following a vegan diet to find a
substitute. Some people also choose milk alternatives due to taste preferences
or the perceived health benefits. However it’s important to know that milk
alternatives differ in the nutrition they provide. A common misconception is
that dairy products increase mucus production, and while they can coat the
lining of the throat and make it feel that way, there is no evidence to this
So how do you know which type of milk is the right choice for you?
Full fat milk contains roughly 4% fat, which makes it an ideal choice for
children under the age of two years who require the extra energy and
kilojoules for growth and development. Full fat milk is also generally
recommended for those struggling to gain weight or at risk of malnutrition.
Low fat milks contain roughly 1% fat, while skim milk is as low as 0.01% fat.
For most of the population low fat or skim milk is recommended in order to
reduce saturated fat and kilojoule intake. Some people don’t like the more
watery taste of a skim milk, so reduced or low fat milk is a good compromise.
There is a common misconception that more sugar is added to low fat or skim
milk, however this is not the case. Unless it is a flavoured or sweetened
milk, no sugar is added to cow’s milk. The naturally occurring sugar in milk
is known as lactose and this is found in the watery portion of milk, meaning
that when the fat is removed or reduced we do end up with slightly more sugar,
protein and other nutrients. However the difference is very small and makes no
measurable difference to blood glucose levels. The difference in naturally
occurring sugar in a cup of full fat milk vs low fat milk is less than half a
Lactose free milk is a great option for people who experience lactose
intolerance or an inability to digest the naturally occurring sugar in milk.
The milk is treated with the addition of an enzyme that pre-digests the
lactose, meaning it can be tolerated by those with lactose intolerance.
Although lactose is the naturally occurring sugar in milk, this doesn’t make
any difference to the sugar content of milk. The sugar is simply broken down,
Milk is naturally comprised of two different proteins, a mix of A1 and A2
proteins. However we now have available milks that only contain the A2 type of
protein due to special selection of the cows producing the milk. While lots of
health claims are made about A2 milk, currently there is a lack of good
quality evidence to suggest it is better than milk containing a mix of both
proteins. However in some instances of intolerance symptoms, it is reported
that people may experience less digestive discomfort with A2 milk.
Soy milk is free of lactose and milk protein, making it a great alternative
for those who can’t or choose not to have dairy. It is the closest of the
alternatives to cow’s milk in terms of protein and carbohydrate content,
however it is naturally low in calcium. Be sure to choose a calcium-fortified
Low in both protein and carbohydrate, almond milk and other nut milks like
macadamia contain a very small proportion of nuts and are mostly water. Like
soy milk they are naturally low in calcium, and it is important to choose a
calcium-fortified variety. Many options also have added sugar, so choose a no-
added-sugar version if you use nut milk. While they can be a low carbohydrate
and kilojoule option for those following a low carb diet, they don’t offer as
much from a nutritional perspective as cow’s milk or soy.
Made from grains, oat milk and rice milk are generally low in protein and high
in carbohydrate. As they lack the fibre and nutrition of consuming the
wholegrain, they may not make the best choice for people with diabetes. If you
prefer the taste keep portion sizes small and like all non-dairy milks be sure
Higher in naturally occurring saturated fat coconut milk is one to save for
adding flavour to special dishes, rather than as an everyday milk alternative.
The bottom line is that for most people who do not follow a special or
restricted diet a reduced fat cow’s milk is likely to be the best choice.
Alternative milks can however add variety and interest to your diet, but
should be chosen carefully to maximise nutrients and minimise added sugars.
