### Knowing where to start can be the toughest part of fundraising. But don't
worry, here you'll find ideas to help you reach your fundraising targets. And
there are still loads of fun ways you can raise money for us without leaving
It can be useful to chop your fundraising into milestones, to help you build
up to the bigger amounts. Here are some ideas.
If your first milestone is £25, it's all about getting those small donations
* Create your JustGiving page and donate a small amount to your own page.
* WhatsApp or text 5 to 10 family and friends asking for small donations to help get you started.
* Post your story and JustGiving page on social media, mention that you're trying to reach £25 by a specific day to get people's attention.
* By messaging the people you know directly and setting a time limit on a general post on social media you can hopefully reach your first milestone quickly.
> Believe it or not, just adding a photo to your JustGiving page will raise
> more money. Whether it's a walking shot or your latest baking triumph, add
> it to your page and get sharing. Check out our guide to fundraising online.
Reaching your second milestone requires more of a scatter gun approach. We're
looking for small donations from a large volume of people, and potentially
* Share your JustGiving page across all networks. Social, work, sports, community. Ensure everyone gets a look at your page.
* Get family and friends to share it with their networks too, small donations from people you may not know will add up.
* Offer incentives to your supporters. If you reach £150, you'll wear a fancy dress item, face paint or host a virtual party to celebrate.
> Let everyone know what you're doing and why. Explain what it means to you,
> why you're supporting us and how we help. Take a look at these fundraising
Reaching £150 is a huge achievement, but you might want to go beyond that.
It's here that you can get really creative with your fundraising.
* Hold a virtual event for friends and family, it can be anything you enjoy. A pub quiz, movie night or baking competition. Bring the people you know together to have a great time and they'll show their appreciation. You could even print off some bunting (PDF, 169KB) and decorate your living room for people watching online. We're here to help, so if you're holding a digital fundraiser and need some advice just get in touch.
* Matched funding can be a huge help in your fundraising, talk to your HR team at work (if you have one) and see if they offer the scheme. If they do, your company matches your fundraising for free, or up to a certain amount.
* Repeat your sponsorship requests on pay day. It's simple but effective and you can update people on your progress and fundraising.
There are so many different ways to reach your goals. So the first thing to do
is to start simple and work your way up. See what works with your family,
friends, colleagues and social groups and keep going. We're here to help you
come up with clever ways to keep on making a difference, so get in touch if
