# Sitting for long periods increases risk of Type 2 diabetes
Sitting for long periods of time can increase your risk of developing Type 2
diabetes, heart disease and death, a new study has found.
The study, which analysed the results of 18 studies and included a total of
794,577 participants, is published in the journalDiabetologia. The researchers
are the first to analyse the association between all sedentary behaviour and
long-term health, rather than focusing on time spent watching television.
According to the study, those who sit for long periods of time on a daily
basis double their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, even if they take
Substituting sedentary behaviour with standing or light-intensity physical
activity (in addition to undertaking regular exercise) may reduce the risk of
chronic disease and death. Suggested ways to counteract long sitting periods
include taking regular breaks, having standing meetings, walking during your
lunch break and reducing your TV viewing time by taking part in less-sedentary

overall health and considerably increases your risk of developing Type 2
"The suggestion that even those people who are physically active but also sit
down for long periods have an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes is
interesting. However, not all of the studies in this review looked at this
factor, so the evidence is not strong and certainly shouldn’t be used to
"What is clear is that anyone who spends lots of time sitting or lying down
would benefit from replacing some of that time by standing or walking. Aside
from any direct effect reducing the amount of time you spend sitting down may
have, getting more physical activity is a great way of helping maintain a
healthy weight, which is the best way of minimising your risk of Type 2
