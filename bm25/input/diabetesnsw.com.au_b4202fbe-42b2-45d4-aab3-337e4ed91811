# Is that drink as healthy as it seems?
We all know how important it is to drink enough fluid to stay hydrated in hot
weather or when we exercise. But how do we know the drinks we are choosing are
healthy? Let’s dig a bit deeper into the options available to us and consider
The main aim for a drink is hydration and the best source of hydration is
water. Tap water is a great choice as it’s practically free and easily
available. Drink your water at room temperature or chilled, put it in a pretty
glass or a useful water bottle - it's your choice. Remember to drink it
regularly and not wait until you are thirsty.
Brewing your water as tea or coffee is fine as a source of fluid as the amount
of caffeine a cuppa contains is quite low. Most adults can drink up to 300mg
per day without side-effects. However, too much caffeine causes dehydration so
Any drink containing carbohydrate will increase BGLs. The carbohydrate may be
in the form of added sugar, such as in sugar-sweetened soft drinks, cordial,
energy drinks, sports drinks and many alcoholic drinks. But you will also find
naturally occurring sugars in drinks such as milk and fruit juice. Some drinks
are much lower than others in sugar, for example milk, coconut water and
Artificially sweetened drinks, such as diet soft drink and diet cordial, won’t
affect your BGLs but they train your taste buds to like sweet drinks. While
these drinks can be a useful option, if you don’t mind the artificial
sweetener, drinking unsweetened drinks is always going to be better. Plain
soda water or plain mineral water is the best choice.
Note - sugar-sweetened drinks can be helpful when treating a hypo.
Drinks containing carbohydrate, particularly soft drink, can provide
500-1000kJ per 375mL drink (a standard can). This has been recognised as a
major cause of overweight in Australia. Other sugar-sweetened drinks such as
cordial, energy drinks and fruit juice will also contribute to a larger
Alcoholic drinks contain energy from alcohol as well as energy from the base
drink, so they give you a double whammy for the waistline.
Some drinks, such as milk, contain fat and protein and contribute to your
energy (calorie or kilojoule) intake; however, they also provide some positive
nourishment from the protein and minerals and have a lower GI (glycaemic
## Effects on your teeth – acid drinks
Many drinks cause acid to form or are acidic to start with and can damage
***Sugar containing drinks**. Bacteria in your mouth eats sugar in both sugar-sweetened drinks and those with naturally occuring sugars, resulting in a waste product which is quite acidic.
***Carbonated drinks** have carbon dioxide added to make the bubbles and while the fluid is great for your body, as all water is, the carbonation means the water becomes more acidic.
***Citrus flavourings** add to the acidity of some drinks.
* The **fermentation** and natural carbonation of kombucha also cause the drink to be quite acidic.
Some drinks have naturally occurring vitamins, such as fruit or vegetable
juice. Others include minerals, such as mineral water, green coconut water and
dairy milk, which are great for our health. Some drinks have added nutrients
which might be useful, for example vegetarians may choose calcium fortified
plant-based milks as a source of calcium for strong bones and teeth.
Be careful not to overconsume milkshakes, smoothies and juices as they are so
easy to drink in large volumes and can contribute to a larger waistline.
Consider whether you would eat the equivalent fruit, vegetables and wholefoods
Other drinks have added nutrients suitable for specialised audiences, such as
electrolyte containing sports drinks for high level athletes. These are not
suitable for the average exerciser, or those with diarrhoea and vomiting.
If you live in an area where your tap water is fluoridated it will strengthen
your teeth enamel and help prevent dental caries which is a great benefit.
Some drinks, such as probiotic-containing drinks, or kombucha, help to create
a healthy microbial balance in your digestive tract.
Other drinks, including energy drinks and some juices, have added ingredients
such as taurine, B group vitamins, ginseng and guarana, or advertise they may
be used to replace whole fruits and vegetables. Given the choice it is better
to choose whole foods to supply these nutrients rather than rely on drinks.
* Uncarbonated (still) bottled waters, including mineral and spring waters
* Milk in moderation. If you have high ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol or are trying to reduce your waistline choose lower fat varieties
* Plain soda water or plain carbonated mineral or spring water in small amounts
* Limited amounts of drinks which improve your gut health such as probiotic drinks
* Small amounts of home juiced fruit and veggies – juice the whole fruit to get as much fibre as possible (although without hard skins)
* Sugar-sweetened drinks, especially if they are carbonated
* Large serves of fruit juice, sweetened milk drinks/smoothies
