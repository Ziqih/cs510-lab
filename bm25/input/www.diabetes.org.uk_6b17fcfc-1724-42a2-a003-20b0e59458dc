250 g/9 oz wholegrain rice, rinsed in several changes of water, then drained
2 large skinless chicken breasts (400g), trimmed of excess fat
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160° fan)/350F/gas mark 4. 
2. Heat the sunflower oil in an ovenproof casserole or baking dish set over a medium heat until hot. 
3. Stir in the rice and sauté in the oil for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Sprinkle over the spices and cook for a further 2 minutes until fragrant. 
4. Cover with the water, stirring well. Bring to the boil before arranging the squash and chicken on top of the rice.
5. Loosely cover the dish with aluminium foil and transfer to the oven, baking for about 30 minutes until the rice has absorbed the water and the chicken is cooked through. 
6. Remove from the oven and discard the foil. Sprinkle almonds on top and return the dish to the oven for 7-10 minutes until the almonds are golden-brown.
7. Remove from the oven. Transfer the chicken to a plate and let it cool for 5 minutes before shredding between two forks.
8. Stir some lemon juice into the pilaf and fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains. 
9. Top with the shredded chicken and garnish with some coriander leaves before serving. 
* Yellow squashes are available from good grocers and supermarkets. Look for a squash that is approximately 250-350g in weight. 
* To add colour and variety, replace half the sliced almonds with unsalted cashew and pistachio nuts.
