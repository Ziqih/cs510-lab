### Weight is a sensitive issue for many people and getting to an ideal,
healthy weight is easier said than done. But when you have diabetes, there are
huge benefits to losing weight if you're carrying extra weight.
You’ll have more energy, feel better in yourself, and you’ll reduce your risk
of serious complications like heart disease and stroke. And if you have type 2
diabetes, losing weight could even mean going into diabetes remission.
But millions of people with diabetes find keeping to a healthy weight a huge
struggle. You're not alone in this, there's support out there to help – a good
first step is to ask your healthcare team for help and advice.

Extra weight around your waist means fat can build up around your organs, like
your liver and pancreas. This can cause something called insulin resistance.
So losing this weight could help the insulin you produce or the insulin you
And as you start to lose weight and get more active, you and your healthcare
team may need to look at your medication, especially if you treat your
diabetes with insulin or sulphonylurea. This might mean reducing the dose or
making other adjustments, but talk to your healthcare team about it. For some
people, needing fewer diabetes medications is a great motivation for losing
Although getting type 1 diabetes has nothing to do with weight, losing any
extra weight will help you reduce your risk of complications and could mean
And if you have type 2 diabetes, losing around 15kg could even put you into
diabetes remission. This could mean coming off your diabetes medication
completely – a life-changing possibility. This is even more likely if you lose

“We know that losing even 5% of your weight helps improve blood pressure and
cholesterol levels. This can have a big impact on your overall health and go a

## What’s a healthy weight to aim for?
Before you get started, you need to know what a healthy weight is and what
numbers you’re aiming for. This is about working out your Body Mass Index
Research shows that the more weight you lose, the greater the health benefits,
but even losing just 5% of extra weight will improve your health.
BMI uses your height and weight to work out if you're a healthy weight. It
doesn’t look at how much fat you have around the middle, so that’s why you
need to measure your waist too. You can work your BMI out for yourself using
this NHS tool – it will show you your target range.
For many people living with obesity, aiming for a healthy BMI may not be
A healthy waist size depends on your gender and ethnicity. It should be:
* less than 80cm (31.5in) for all women
* less than 94cm (37in) for most men
* less than 90cm (35in) for South Asian men.
Here’s our community champion Rohit to show you how to measure your waist.
There is no such thing as a special diet exclusively for people with diabetes.
There are a lot of different ways to lose weight – but there’s no one-size-
### It starts with finding a way to eat fewer calories than you need.
A calorie (or kcal) is a unit of energy, which is in the food and drink we
consume. Your body uses energy for everything we do – from breathing and
sleeping to exercising. When you eat, you’re replacing the energy you’ve used,
which helps you to maintain a healthy weight.
As a general guide, government recommendations are that men need around
2,500kcal a day to maintain a healthy weight, and women need around 2,000kcal
a day. But most people need different amounts of calories based on how their
bodies work, how active they are and any weight management goals.
We’ve put together some 7-day meal plans to help you lose weight. They're all
clinically approved, nutritionally balanced, calorie and carb counted, and can
* Lower-calorie diet plans, like 1,200 or 1,500 calories a day
Evidence shows that the best approach is the one that you’re likely to stick
to. So the key is to find a plan that you enjoy and fits in with the rest of
your life. Everyone’s different and what works for some may not for others.
A low-calorie diet is made up of between 800 to 1200 calories a day – our
DiRECT study used a low-calorie diet of around 850 calories a day. But DiRECT
is not a diet. It’s testing a weight-management programme, delivered in GP

We haven't created low or very-low calorie meal plans as these could be
challenging using foods. Most people who follow these diets use special meal
replacement products which are nutritionally complete. If you chose to try a
low-calorie diet like the one in DiRECT, speak to your GP or nurse first,
A low GI diet can help you manage your blood sugar levels, but the evidence
for people with diabetes losing weight is not very strong.
There are other popular diets, like intermittent fasting (such as the 5:2
diet) and the Paleo diet. Unfortunately there isn’t enough strong evidence to
say these are effective for weight loss in people with diabetes either.
Some people feel that they need more support and choose to join a commercial
weight-loss programme. These usually involve calorie-controlled eating plans
It’s really important to ask lots of questions about these programmes, so
you’ve got all the evidence and information you need to make an informed
* Does the programme offer advice on your diabetes (especially if you’re at risk of hypos)?
* Are you getting all the nutrition you need from this programme?
* Does the programme give support and education?
Whether you choose to try one of our meal plans, or another type of diet, it’s
really important that you talk it through with your diabetes team first.
