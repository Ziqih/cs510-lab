##**I am taking oral medications for my diabetes. Will I need insulin in
Sliding scale insulin (insulin doses that slide or move up and down in
conjunction with the direction your blood glucose moves) is frequently used in
hospital to look after high blood glucose levels. Diabetes is harder to look
after in hospital due to the effect of counter regulatory hormones such as
catecholamines, cortisol, growth hormone and glucagon which are released in
response to stress, illness, infection and pain. Sliding scale insulin can be
an effective way to look after high blood glucose levels whilst in hospital
however once discharged you will likely continue on your regular medications
##**Can I use my insulin pump in hospital?**
Using your insulin pump in hospital will depend if the hospital has a policy
in place for the use of insulin pumps. If your cognitive ability is affected
by illness or medication you may not be able to perform the necessary tasks
associated with using your pump. Ask your doctor how they plan to look after
your blood glucose levels during your hospital stay.
Check if you need to detatch your insulin pump before investigations such as
If you are able to use your insulin pump in hospital make sure you take any
extra supplies you might need. Hospitals may not have access to pump supplies.

have nothing to eat or drink. It is important to ask your doctor or diabetes
health care team for any special instructions in regards to adjusting your
insulin or oral medications. You are at a higher risk of experiencing
hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels), ask your doctor or diabetes health
care team how to prevent and/or treat hypos. Ask where you are placed on the
surgical list, the earlier your procedure, the less disruption to your

instructions for you to follow while fasting, especially in regard to
Information on treating hypoglycaemia can be found here.
##**Do I need to check my blood glucose levels more often?**
It is a good idea to check your blood glucose levels more often before and
after your procedure/surgery. Blood glucose levels often go up in response to
stress, illness, infection and pain. Looking after blood glucose levels will
help recovery and reduce the risk of complications, such as infection. Ask
your doctor or diabetes health care team what your target blood glucose levels
should be and how often you should test.
##**Will my oral medications need to be changed?**
Oral medications may need to be changed prior to your procedure or surgery,
especially if you are taking Metformin, Diabex, Diaformin, Glucophage, Metex,
Formet, Forxiga or Jardiance. Ask your doctor how long before your procedure
or surgery you will need to stop these medications. This will only be
temporary and the medications are usually resumed 24-48 hours post surgery.
You may also require more oral medication or insulin after discharge if blood
glucose levels are higher than normal. This may also be temporary while you

home following your procedure/surgery so they can check on you regularly.
