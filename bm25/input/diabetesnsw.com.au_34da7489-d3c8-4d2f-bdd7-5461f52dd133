Diabetes Australia is confident that its KeepSight program, which commenced
just over 12 months ago, will help ensure that the proportion of people with
diabetes accessing eye checks increases in coming years.
The aim of the program is that ultimately, every person with diabetes get the
necessary eye checks and this helps prevent vision loss and blindness.
Diabetes Australia CEO Professor Greg Johnson said KeepSight, an online eye

Researchers found people living with diabetes for 10 or more years were even

eye examinations and early treatment,” said Professor Gillies.
