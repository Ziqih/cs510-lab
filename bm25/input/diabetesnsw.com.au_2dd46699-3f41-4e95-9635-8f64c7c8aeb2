# Gluten free diet may increase risk of type 2
A new report by Harvard University's Department of Nutrition suggests a diet
low in gluten may increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study
looked at the diets of almost 200,000 participants over a thirty-year period,
out of which nearly 16,000 cases of diabetes were confirmed.
The research indicates that there are significant drawbacks for people who eat
considerably less gluten or a gluten free diet. A gluten free diet can lead to
lower intakes of wholegrain carbohydrate foods which are rich in fibre, known
to be protective against type 2 diabetes and heart disease. With a lack of
wholegrain foods, going gluten-free is usually not a healthy balanced diet and
not recommended unless you have a gluten intolerance or diagnosed gluten
 **It is important to note that gluten free diets are extremely important for
people who are gluten intolerant or have coeliac disease** as they are very
sensitive to the protein found in gluten. The gluten causes a reaction and can
destroy integral structures of the gut leading to nutrient deficiencies.
Having a vast supply of gluten free products available at the supermarket is
important for people living with coeliac disease or gluten intolerance,
however gluten free products and the associated diet are not suitable or
People living with diabetes also need to be conscious that gluten free
products tend to be low in fibre, have a higher glycaemic index and can
contain double the amount of carbohydrate as the regular gluten product.
