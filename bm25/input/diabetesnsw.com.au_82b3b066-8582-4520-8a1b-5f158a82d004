1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the spice and stir for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 5 minutes or until softened.
2. Add the cauliflower, split peas, cashews, salt and pepper and stock. Increase the heat to high and bring to the boil. Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes or until the split peas are tender. Add more water if required.
3. Add the chicken, cover and cook for an additional 12 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.
4. Removed the chicken from the soup. Cool and shred.
5. Using a hand stick blender, blend the soup until smooth.
6. Divide the soup between bowls and top with shredded chicken, toasted seeds and croutons.
Hint: Use salt reduced chicken stock for a heart friendly recipe.
You can swap croutons in this recipe for slice of multigrain bread or make
your own croutons. To do so, simply chop a slice of multigrain bread into
thick chunks. Drizzle with small amount of olive oil and toast in the oven for
10 minutes on 180 degrees Celsius. Voila, ready to add onto your soup.
