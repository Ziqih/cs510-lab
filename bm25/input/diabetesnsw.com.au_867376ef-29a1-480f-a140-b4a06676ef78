# How do you stop touching your face?
Part of the advice we’ve received to help keep us well and healthy and limit
the spread of the coronavirus is to stop touching our faces.
But this can be hard right? You may not know this but we can touch our faces
up to 16 times an hour. So we’ve got put together some tips that may help you
##**How do viruses spread when we touch our faces?**

tired eyes, wiping your mouth with the back of your hand are all things we do
In a couple of small studies, scientists researching behaviour found that
In a 2008 study, 10 subjects were each observed alone in an office environment
for 3 hours. Researchers found they touched their faces an average of 16 times
Another study from 2015 observed 26 medical students at a university in
Australia. This study found they touched their faces 23 times per hour. Almost
half of the face touches involved the mouth, nose, or eyes, which are the
easiest pathways for viruses and bacteria to enter our bodies.
While both studies were small they reinforced that face touching is a common
behaviour. Think about it, how often do you touch you face in an hour?
Here are some tips to help you avoid touching your face.
* Be mindful about your intention to keep your hands away from your face. Just a brief pause can help you be more aware of what you’re doing with your hands.
* Place reminders like Post-it notes in your home or office where you can see them to remind you to keep your hands away from your face.
* Keep your hands busy. If you’re at home watching TV, try folding laundry, sort through mail, or hold something in your hands.
* Use a scented hand sanitizer or a scented hand soap to draw your attention to your hands. It will help remind you to keep hands away from your face.
* If you know you habitually touch your face wearing gloves can be an effective physical reminder.
While it may be tough at first, and take a while to get used to, following
these simple tips may help you stop touching your face during the coronavirus
outbreak. It’s a healthy new habit to get in to.
