A US study has found that age plays a critical role in the well-being of
people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, with younger patients more
susceptible to psychological distress resulting in worse health outcomes.
“We found we can evaluate a patient's initial stress and predict how they will
be doing six months later. If you can identify people who are facing diabetes
distress earlier, you can intervene and prevent their health from declining,"
said Professor Vicki Helgeson, Carnegie Mellon University, senior author on
In the study, the team evaluated 207 patients (55% male, 53% white, 47% black,
25-82 years of age), who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the past
They used several surveys to evaluate health, psychological distress and
health care, as well as studied the participants' daily dairies to identify
The researchers assessed patients at the start of the study to establish a
baseline and then six months later. They examined the results with regard to
They found younger patients (42 years and younger) experienced higher
In addition, patients with higher education and income expressed more stress.
Conversely, older patients (older than 64 years) had less psychological stress
and greater consistency in self-care, blood sugar control and medication
Patients in long-term relationships also reported less diabetes stress.
"This is a diverse sample with respect to age, education and race, which makes
the result even more provocative," Helgeson said. "We do not know in an
objective way if patients with a higher income have more stressors, but they
Patients identified diet as the greatest stressor (38%).
Other significant stressors include checking blood glucose (8%) and
experiencing high or low blood glucose events (7%).
Patients who self-reported greater stress also reported greater depressed
mood, less adherence to medication and higher anxiety.
Helgesen said, "Diabetes care is difficult, because it requires a lifestyle
change and life can get in the way of sticking to a diabetes regimen."
While the study was not designed to explore why patients handle stressors
differently, Helgeson believes older adults may live in the present compared
to younger adults, whose focus on the future may magnify their stressors.
Diabetes is also more common as people age, and older patients may find more
support from their peer group. She also suggests older adults may leverage
past experiences to employ emotion regulation strategies to mitigate the
After a diagnosis, many patients experience stress as they modify their
lifestyle to accommodate diet, weight control, medication and exercise
routines, which can be time-consuming, complicated and costly. Complications
from diabetes include heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and lower limb
Helgeson notes that the study was not designed to interpret the cause of
In addition, the daily stress measure was not developed to expand on the
Future studies could evaluate how patients react to stressors to develop
effective intervention and regulation strategies for different age, gender,
