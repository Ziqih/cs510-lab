2006: "definition and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and intermediate
hyperglycaemia". Diabetes UK also welcomes the 2011 decision by the WHO to
accept the use of HbA1c testing in diagnosing diabetes: "use of glycated
>>>>>>> Information on the diagnostic criteria for diabetes is below. For
further information and an explanation of terms and classifications please
>>>>>>> ## Methods and criteria for diagnosing diabetes
>>>>>>> 1. Diabetes symptoms (e.g. polyuria, polydipsia and
>>>>>>> * a random venous plasma glucose concentration ≥ 11.1
>>>>>>> * a fasting plasma glucose concentration ≥ 7.0 mmol/l
>>>>>>> * two hour plasma glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/l two
hours after 75g anhydrous glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
>>>>>>> 2. With no symptoms diagnosis should not be based on a
single glucose determination but requires confirmatory plasma venous
determination. At least one additional glucose test result on another day with
a value in the diabetic range is essential, either fasting, from a random
sample or from the two hour post glucose load. If the fasting random values
are not diagnostic the two hour value should be used.
>>>>>>> The criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes is different.
Gestational diabetes should be diagnosed if the woman has either:
>>>>>>> * a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.6mmol/l or above or
>>>>>>> * a 2-hour plasma glucose level of 7.8mmol/l or above.
>>>>>>> ## Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing to diagnose diabetes
>>>>>>> An HbA1c of 48mmol/mol (6.5%) is recommended as the cut off point for
diagnosing diabetes. A value of less than 48mmol/mol (6.5%) does not exclude
>>>>>>> Finger-prick HbA1c should not be used unless the methodology and the
healthcare staff and facility using it can demonstrate within the national
quality assurance scheme that they match the quality assurance results found
in laboratories. Finger prick tests must be confirmed by laboratory venous
>>>>>>> In patients without symptoms of diabetes the laboratory venous HbA1c
should be repeated. If the second sample is <48mmol/mol (6.5%) the person
should be treated as at high risk of diabetes and the test should be repeated
in 6 months or sooner if symptoms develop.
>>>>>>> ### Situations where HbA1c is not appropriate for diagnosis of
>>>>>>> * patients of any age suspected of having Type 1 diabetes
>>>>>>> * patients with symptoms of diabetes for less than 2 months
>>>>>>> * patients at high risk who are acutely ill (e.g. those
>>>>>>> * patients taking medication that may cause rapid glucose
>>>>>>> * patients with acute pancreatic damage, including
>>>>>>> * presence of genetic, haematologic and illness-related
factors that influence HbA1c and its measurement (see annex 1 of the WHO
report for a list of factors which influence HbA1c and its measurement)
>>>>>>> ### Patients whose HbA1c is under 48 mmol/mol (6.5%)
>>>>>>> * These patients may still fulfill WHO glucose criteria for
>>>>>>> * The use of such glucose tests is not recommended
routinely, but use WHO glucose testing in patients who have symptoms of
diabetes or clinically are at very high risk of diabetes.
