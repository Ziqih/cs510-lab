2 tsp curry paste (mild or as hot as you like)
1. Wash the spinach and add to a pan with a lid, cook for 2-3 minutes stirring a couple of times (there is no need to add oil or extra water, there will be enough water clinging to the spinach after washing). Put into a sieve and reserve.
2. Meanwhile, add the oil to a pan, add the onion and cook for 2-3 minutes until softened.
3. Now add the garlic and stir for 2 minutes, then mix in the curry paste.
4. Add the spinach, mix well for 1-2 minutes, then stir in the crème fraîche and serve.
* For a vegan version, use a soya-based yogurt instead of crème fraîche.
* You can also mix in a few boiled, chopped potatoes to create a quick sag aloo.
* Freezing instructions: Defrost in the microwave then reheat until piping hot.
