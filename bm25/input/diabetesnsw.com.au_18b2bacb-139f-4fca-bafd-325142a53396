Unfortunately, gestational diabetes can’t always be avoided. Even if you are a
healthy weight, run marathons and steer clear of all processed foods you could
still end up being diagnosed with gestational diabetes.
The main things that increase your risk of developing gestational diabetes
* A family history of type 2 diabetes
* Certain ethnic backgrounds, including Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, Indian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Middle Eastern or Polynesian
* Unexplained stillbirth or neonatal deaths or having previously given birth to a very large baby
* Some types of anti-psychotic or steroid medications
Most of these things can’t be changed. However, it’s good to know which ones

idea to see your GP to be checked for type 2 diabetes before becoming pregnant
When you do fall pregnant again, your GP might ask you to start monitoring
your blood glucose levels even before you have had the oral glucose tolerance
test (OGTT). The OGTT is where you drink the sugary drink and have a blood
test. It is not uncommon for your GP to offer you an early OGTT test at around

Gestational diabetes is an extra thing to carry on top of chasing around after
your first born, coping with work and whatever else life throws at you.
