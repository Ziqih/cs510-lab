# Reflux drugs increase risk of type 2 diabetes
Regular use of acid reflux drugs, known as proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs for
short, is linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Research published in the journal Gut suggests the longer these drugs are
As a result the researchers advise people taking reflux drugs for more than
two years to have regular blood glucose check-ups to screen for diabetes.
PPIs are used to treat acid reflux, peptic ulcers, and indigestion. They are
among the top 10 most commonly used drugs worldwide.
Long-term use has been linked to an increased risk of bone fractures, chronic
With the global prevalence of type 2 diabetes increasing the researchers
wanted to find out if the widespread use of PPIs and the high prevalence of
They drew on information supplied by 204 689 participants (176,050 women and
28,639 men) aged 25 to 75 in the US Nurses’ Health Study, which started in
1976 (NHS), the NHS II, which started in 1989, and the Health Professionals
At enrolment and every 2 years after that, participants updated information on
their health behaviours, medical history, and newly diagnosed conditions.
Starting in 2000 for the NHS, 2001 for NHS II, and 2004 for the HPFS,
participants were also asked whether they had used PPIs regularly in the
preceding 2 years: regular use was defined as 2 or more times a week.
During the average tracking period of around 9 to 12 years across all three
groups, 10,105 participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The annual
absolute risk of a diagnosis among regular PPI users was 7.44/1000 compared
with 4.32/1000 among those who didn’t take these drugs.
After taking account other influential factors, like high blood pressure, high
cholesterol, physical inactivity and use of other medication, those who
regularly used PPIs were 24% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those
And the longer these drugs were taken, the greater was the risk of developing
diabetes: use for up to 2 years was associated with a 5% increased risk; use
for more than 2 years was associated with a 26% increased risk.
The risk fell the more time had elapsed since stopping.
Further analysis showed that diabetes risk among PPI users wasn’t affected by
sex, age, family history of diabetes, smoking, alcohol intake, diet, physical
activity, high cholesterol or regular use of anti-inflammatory drugs.
But it was higher among participants who weren’t overweight or who had normal
For comparison, the researchers also looked at the potential impact of H2
blockers, another type of drug used to curb excess stomach acid production.
Regular use of these drugs was associated with a 14% increased risk.
Similarly, longer term use was associated with a higher risk while longer time
since stopping was associated with a lower risk.
This is an observational study, and as such, can’t establish cause, but it
involves many people whose health was tracked over a relatively long period,
A mounting body of evidence suggests that changes in the type and volume of
bacteria in the gut (the microbiome) may help explain the associations found
between PPI use and an increased risk of developing diabetes, they add.
“Owing to wide usage, the overall number of diabetes cases associated with PPI
Given the range of side effects and the heightened risk of diabetes, doctors
should carefully weigh up the pros and cons of prescribing these drugs, they
caution. “For patients who have to receive long term PPI treatment, screening
for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes is recommended,” they suggest.
