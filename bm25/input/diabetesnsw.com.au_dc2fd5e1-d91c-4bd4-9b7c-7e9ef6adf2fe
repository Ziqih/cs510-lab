* Type 2 diabetes and me – online course
I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at six years old (15 years ago). It was
hard to understand what that meant at the time and it really fell onto my
parents to care and manage my diabetes. At first I was on needles for insulin
having approximately 5 a day and having anywhere between 5 and 10 BGL checks a
day. Unfortunately, my little sister was also diagnosed with Type 1, two years
later at just six months old. It was much harder watching a baby have to
endure needle after needle than it ever was for me to have to have the same
Not long after my sister’s diagnosis we were both put on the Medtronic Insulin
pump. This was a very different form of treatment and it was hard to get used
to wearing a device constantly. My parents cared for us and our diabetes every
day and every night. Having two children with type 1 isn’t easy on any family.
My sister and I became Youth Ambassadors for JDRF and spent many days at
Parliament House and State Parliament working to get funding for research and

BGL checks on me during 17-hour flights so I didn’t have to wake up, helped me
manage the effects of alcohol on diabetes and the different treatments
required, and, has always been a pillar of strength when I just needed to
I completed my bachelor’s degree last year on my 21st birthday and have since
begun working as an Internal Audit and Financial Advisory consultant in
Canberra. Everyday there are new challenges to face with Type 1 diabetes and
sometimes all you want to do is scream and ask why me? But I have been very
fortunate that throughout my whole journey I have had an incredible support
network built of family, friends and doctors/nutritionists/social workers who
have enabled me to still live a great life with an autoimmune disease.
I hope that by sharing my story we can spread more understanding around Type 1
