As the temperature outside begins to get cooler, our muscles and joints take
that little bit longer to warm up and work at their best. As a result, it’s
important to consider an extended warm up of at least 10-15 minutes, before
commencing exercise. Our muscles are much like rubber bands and work more
effectively when they are warm, so they can lengthen and recoil smoothly.
Exercising cold muscles can be quite risky and can lead to injury. It is for
this reason, that dynamic stretching should be incorporated into your warm up
Dynamic stretches are active movements where joints and muscles go through
full range of movement. They are a great way to warm up your body before
exercise and can be functional and mimic the movement of the activity you’re
about to perform. For example, if you’re about to go walking or jogging, you
might like to consider marching/jogging on the spot, leg swings (backwards,
forwards and side to side), body rotations, star jumps and lunges.
Alternatively, if you are going swimming, you might include arm circles, trunk
twists and other chest and shoulder mobility exercises.
Once your muscles and joints are warm, you can proceed with your planned
exercise session and slowly increase the intensity where appropriate. Remember
the main part of your exercise session should be at a 'lightly puffing'
intensity and you should be able to maintain a conversation. Thirty minutes
per day of moderate intensity exercise is recommended for people living with
diabetes and this can be a combination of both aerobic and resistance
Traditional static stretches should also be included at the end of your
exercise session, as part of your cool down, when your muscles are more
responsive to stretching or lengthening. Stretch all of the major muscle
groups you have exercised during your session. So, with walking/jogging it is
recommended you stretch your lower back, hamstrings, glutes, hip flexors,
quads and calves. Whereas with swimming you would focus on your chest,
shoulders and upper back muscles. Stretches should be held for 30 seconds and
it is important to maintain normal breathing, as opposed to holding your
## Some other things to consider when exercising during winter

 **Dress warmly** – consider wearing layers, so you can remove outer layers as
you start to warm up and put them back on at the end of your exercise session.
