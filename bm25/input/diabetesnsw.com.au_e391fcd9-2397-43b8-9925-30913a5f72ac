Metformin is the first drug of choice in the treatment of high blood glucose
levels in adults and children over 10 years of age with type 2 diabetes. It is
also used for people with gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome.
It is especially useful for people who are overweight or obese, when diet and
exercise are not enough to lower high blood glucose levels.
In adults, Metformin can be used alone, or in combination with other oral
diabetes medications, or in combination with insulin. It works on both fasting
blood glucose levels as well as after meals, by lowering the amount of glucose
made by the liver, which in turn makes the body’s cells more sensitive to the
action of insulin, and delays the uptake of glucose by the gut. All this
without increasing risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels). It may
also lower cholesterol and triglycerides, and promote a small amount of weight
loss. Hypoglycaemia is extremely rare when Metformin is used on its own.
Metformin should be started at a low dose (500 mg/day), and always taken
during or immediately after meals (with a glass of water), at about the same
time each day. This will reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects
and help you to remember to take it. The dose may be increased slowly
Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and pain,
diarrhoea and anorexia. These often subside within a few weeks, but can
persist in some people. If they become intolerable, see your doctor before
making any changes. Side effects are less likely with the extended-release
formulation, which was developed to minimise side effects and improve
absorption and tolerability. It is taken once a day, which may make it easier
Another side effect of Metformin is a vitamin B12 deficiency in some people,
especially in the elderly. A yearly blood test is recommended, and treatment
Metformin is very useful long term, and is stopped only in certain
circumstances, such as kidney failure, severe liver disease, moderate to
severe heart failure, diabetic ketoacidosis (a symptom of unmanaged diabetes,
in which substances called ketones build up in the blood – you may notice this
as a fruity odour on your breath, difficulty breathing, confusion and frequent
urination), or if you are currently breastfeeding, or plan to breastfeed.
It is stopped temporarily before and after major surgery, or an examination
requiring a contrast injection or dye. It’s important that you follow your
And lastly, as with all medications, speak with your doctor before you make
any changes to the type, dose or time that you take your medications.
If you have any questions about your diabetes management, including your
medications, speak with your doctor or pharmacist, or call the Diabetes NSW &
ACT info line on 1300 342 238 and ask to speak with a diabetes educator.
