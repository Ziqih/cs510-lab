>>>>>>> # Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care
>>>>>>> The Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care (JBDS-IP) was
created in 2008 to ‘deliver a set of diabetes inpatient guidelines and propose
standards of care within secondary care organisations’. JBDS-IP is supported
by Diabetes UK, the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists (ABCD) and
the Diabetes Inpatient Specialist Nurse (DISN) UK Group. The core members of
JBDS-IP are listed below, and all four nations represented. Twice yearly face
to face meetings interspersed with teleconferences ensure regular contact
>>>>>>> The overall aim of JBDS-IP is to improve inpatient diabetes care
throughout the UK. This is mainly through the development and use of high-
quality evidence based guidelines, and through better inpatient care pathways.
>>>>>>> Over the past year JBDS-IP has been working with the Care Quality
Commission (CQC) on inpatient diabetes care as a specific disease area for
attention during an Acute Trust inspection. The care of people with diabetes
in care homes has also been discussion with CQC, and this work is being led by
Professor Alan Sinclair, Director of the Institute of Diabetes for Older
>>>>>>> 2014 saw the start of a JBDS-IP annual competitive award for inpatient
insulin safety - ‘The Rowan Hillson Insulin Safety Award’. This year UK Trusts
were invited to submit their insulin charts for a best in class competition.
