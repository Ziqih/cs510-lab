It’s important to make sure it suits your needs, and the best way to find the
right one is to chat to your diabetes educator or pharmacist. They can also
provide you with additional information, further instruction and support.
Once you have a monitor take the time to read through the manual. This will
tell you how to change the time and date (for day light saving, travel),
troubleshoot problems and the correct testing technique to use (eg how to
Once you’re comfortable with your monitor choice, it’s important to know your
testing times, the target range for your results and what you need to do when
your BGLs are outside your range. Talk to your doctor or diabetes educator
about your times, target levels and what action to take.
Many monitors have inbuilt recording of results, however, if you have a
doctor’s visit it’s always a good idea to write down your results for a couple
of weeks prior to the appointment. Add in any comments such as sick day, extra
## Why am I getting different results when I test twice?
People sometimes ask why testing the same finger twice may give different
results. This can be because the first drop of blood is thicker with more
concentrated blood cells so the result may be slightly higher than the second
drop. Some educators and monitor companies will recommend wiping away the
If you have unpredictable results it may be time for a review of you monitor
and testing method with your diabetes educator. If a result is much higher or
lower that you usual ones, repeat the test with re-cleaned hands. It may be
that your blood glucose level is accurate so compare this with any symptoms
you may feel. Many situations effect your levels such as medications like
Errors in your results can happen especially if you don’t have clean hands or
struggle to obtain a drop of blood. Environmental factors such as temperature
can still effected the accuracy of the result as well.
You can check the accuracy of your monitor using control solution, which
provides a pre-determined result range. If your monitor doesn’t return the
same result as the range listed on the control solution bottle, your monitor
is likely to be faulty. Manufacturers will replace faulty monitors if they
read outside the range and will also provide you with control solution free of
## So how do I know what I am buying?
All monitors sold in Australia for people to test their blood glucose level
must meet the international standard called ISO 15197:2013 by May 2016.
This works to ensure reasonable accuracy. BGL results from the monitor are
compared to laboratory measurements. These comparison tests also cover whether
the accuracy of the result in effected by other interferents (a substance that
results in an incorrect result) such as drugs like ibuprofen, the volume of
red blood cells (haematocrit level), or cholesterol levels. There are twenty
four different interferents tested for. How the monitor is used is also
evaluated to ensure user error does not compromise the result.
###**To achieve the ISO standard, 99% of the results must be within 15%
(plus or minus) of the true result. For ISO 2013, for an actual true value of
5.0 mmom/L the result must fall between 6.0 and 4.0 to be accurate.**
The previous standard (ISO 2003) was 95% of the results must be within 20%
The new standard has meant that more accurate monitors are available in the

Your monitor may be 1 to 2mmol/L higher or lower than your actual BGL
depending on your monitor type and if it meets ISO 2013. Health professionals
understand this. Remember monitors older than 2013 may only meet the 2003
standard and are therefore are not as accurate.
## How do I find out if my monitor meets the standard?
The quickest way is to do a “google” search online for ISO 2013 and your
monitor name. This should provide a simple statement such as “meets ISO
standard 15197:2013”. It can also often be found on the manufacturer’s
information supplied with a monitor or you can contact the manufacturer’s
