* Type 2 diabetes and me – online course
We were living in a small country town when I was diagnosed at nine years old.
I fell extremely ill and the doctor told me that I had just ‘come down with
something’, but I could hardly get off the couch, could hardly speak because
my mouth was so dry and within a week I had lost 10kg. The same doctor took
one look at me and told me to go to the local hospital to get my BSL tested.
My BSL came back at 50, and the nurses were shocked I hadn’t gone into a coma.
My mum drove to Tamworth Hospital to be treated as our town’s hospital didn’t
have the services to assist – but it was an hour away. I can still remember
dozing off in the car (more than likely going into a coma) and mum kept saying
“Sylvia, stay awake! Don’t fall asleep!” trying to keep me alert while
driving. I spent a week in the hospital and was taught by the nurses how to do
I have always been a fitness enthusiast and have led an active lifestyle. I
competed in my first fitness competition in September 2014 which required over
three months of strict dieting, training and 110% dedication. This preparation
was sometimes a challenge with my type 1 diabetes, mainly due to the risk of
hypos. I didn’t place, but I was honoured to receive the Luke Wood achievement
award in recognition of competing with type 1 diabetes. Following this I
competed in the NABBA/WFF Sydney Grand Classic in the bikini division and
In 2018 I competed in the Sparke Helmore Triathlon. My goal of competing in
the event was to inspire other diabetes and show that despite having this
condition, you can still lead an active lifestyle and participate in sporting
events such as a triathlon. I chose to compete in the Enticer Race and
thoroughly enjoyed the experience, I had a smile on my face the entire time! I
wanted to complete the race without having to stop due to diabetes (such as a
hypo etc) and achieved this on the day. I did stop during the transitions to
quickly check my BSL and make sure this was within an acceptable range. I
ended up coming 4th place within my division and was extremely happy with this
result. I am now looking for my next challenge!
I am a strong believer in not letting diabetes stop you from following your
dreams. To me, diabetes is very much a part of your life, but not something
that should automatically put up barriers as to what you can and can't do -
there are always workarounds and different ways to do things, it might just
Positivity, strong support networks and the desire to achieve your goals are
all things that will see you succeed. I am happy to speak to others about my
story and share thoughts on type one diabetes and an active lifestyle, so if
you would like to chat please reach out.
