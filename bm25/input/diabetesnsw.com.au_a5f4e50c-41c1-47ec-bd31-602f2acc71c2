Travel, whether for business or pleasure, can and should be fun. Having
diabetes doesn’t mean you can’t travel – but you should put time into planning
to make sure your trip is safe, fun and hassle-free, whether it’s interstate
Keep these things in mind when making your plans:
* Talk to your doctor or credentialed diabetes educator about your travel plans
* Arrange a letter from your doctor and any scripts you might need, and have your NDSS card with you
* Arrange to have all the medication and testing devices you’ll need for your entire trip including insulin, syringes/pen needles or pump and consumables, lancets, test strips and meter
* If travelling overseas, talk to your doctor about any vaccinations you might need
* Arrange travel insurance for you and your belongings

* If flying, be prepared for delays or lost baggage (just in case!)
* Think about how different time zones and climates may affect you and how you manage your diabetes – ask your doctor or diabetes educator for advice about this before you go
* If something should go wrong, don’t panic – seek medical assistance
