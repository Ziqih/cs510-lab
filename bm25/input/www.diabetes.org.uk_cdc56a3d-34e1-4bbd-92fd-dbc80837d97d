# Number of people with obesity almost doubles in 20 years
The number of people who are obese in England has almost doubled in the last
20 years from 6.9 to 13 million, according to new analysis we are releasing
The figures from the Health Survey for England (1997-2017)* estimate that
there are now 13 million people over the age of 16 with a BMI of 30 or above
which classifies as obese, an increase of more than 6 million since 1997.
## Obesity is main driver for increase in type 2
In England 29% of adults and 20% of 10 to 11 year olds are living with obesity
and, although it’s not the only factor, obesity is the most significant risk
factor for new cases of type 2 diabetes, accounting for 80 to 85% of someone’s
It’s the main driver behind the leap in type 2 diabetes cases over the last 20
years. There are an estimated 2.85 million people diagnosed with type 2
diabetes in England, and more than 850,000 living with the condition who don’t

Obesity is contributing to the increase in gestational diabetes and the
worrying rise in young people with type 2 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes is serious because it can lead to devastating and life-

More than half of all cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented or delayed,

Reducing the number of people developing type 2 diabetes and gestational
diabetes is one of five key goals for our ambitious new strategy, which we're
launching today to mark World Diabetes Day 2019.
By 2025, this is what we want to achieve.
* More people with type 1, type 2 and all other forms of diabetes will benefit from new treatments that cure or prevent the condition. 
* More people will be in remission from type 2 diabetes. 
* More people will get the quality of care they need to manage their diabetes well. 
* Fewer people will get type 2 and gestational diabetes. 
* More people will live better and more confident lives with diabetes, free from discrimination.
*The estimate of number of adults over 16 living with obesity in England has been calculated by using the rate of obesity from the Health Survey England applied to the population estimates from the ONS
