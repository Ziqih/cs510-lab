* Type 2 diabetes and me – online course
I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at 14 years of age, (21 years ago).
I lost weight, was super thirsty and kept falling asleep in random places. As
you can imagine, this is a hard age for any teenager but to then be diagnosed
with a ‘chronic illness’ is not the best timing when all you want to do is fit
in and be ‘normal’. I continued to go under the radar and was ashamed of
living with diabetes so therefore did not acknowledge it or speak of it to
I guess in a sense I pretended not to have it.
It wasn’t until my mid-twenties that I started to embrace the facts that I had
diabetes and openly sharing it with others. I was fitted with a Medtronic
Insulin Pump after 11 years and I love that it provides much more flexibility
In this same year I got married and 1 year later we had our first child a boy,
and are now proud parents to four beautiful children (3 boys and a girl) who
are between 2 and 8 years of age. I have forever been grateful for the
advancements in technology for me to have healthy, happy, easy pregnancies. I
also run a successful online health, wellness and cosmetics company & have
been able to step in to my own and live a life I only ever dreamed of.
Diabetes is something that affects you every single day, but, it doesn’t have
to control your life, or limit what you are capable of. Don’t let it define
you, let it empower you. The fact I was able to carry and give birth to
children, that are all healthy & happy. We also travel numerous times a year
of overseas, I participate in sport and live a life of a normal person with no
barriers. You may have been diagnosed with diabetes, now go out and show the
world what you are made of by showing what is possible.
