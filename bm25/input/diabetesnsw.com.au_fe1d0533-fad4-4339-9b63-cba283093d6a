I have always lived a healthy lifestyle and encouraged others to eat well and
be active, even before I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. In high school, I
played loads of sports and was motivated to do well in class, but was having
difficulty staying focused during lessons. I guess most teenagers would think
that is normal, but I knew something was up. I went to the doctor with my mum
and he ordered some blood tests just to check things out. The next day, I
remember being at school and receiving a phone call from my mum “Meet me at
the front office now, we need to go back to the doctor - don’t worry, it will
That day, back in 2007, I was very shocked to be diagnosed with type 1. No one
in my family had a history of diabetes and I was probably the healthiest
person I knew. I spent a week in hospital and although I had lots of visitors,
I felt very isolated. I was probably the most unhappy I have ever been and
There was a silver lining though. While I was in hospital, thinking “why me”,
I decided if I did well in my HSC, I could go to uni and study ways to help
other people avoid developing preventable chronic conditions – I made this my
goal, as well as looking after my own diabetes well.
I am passionate about promoting health and wellbeing among young people,
reducing health inequity and creating communities which make it easy for
everyone to live a healthy lifestyle. I have completed my Masters of Public
Health and a Bachelor degree in Exercise and Sport Science at the University
of Sydney. I work in prevention research and in my spare time work on a mobile
app I developed to help people be active. I also used to work as a personal
trainer with kids and adults helping others have fun while being active.
Having diabetes is now just part of my life. It is tricky but shouldn’t stop
you from doing what you want to do, if you are prepared. I always make sure
those around me are aware I have type 1, in case anything ever goes wrong (but
it doesn’t). I have been working hard to achieve what I set out to do in that
hospital bed when I was 16 years old.
