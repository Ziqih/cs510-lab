>>>>>>> Type 1 diabetes was a mystery to me several years ago. Nobody I knew
closely had it and I thought it was something that always developed in
>>>>>>> My diabetes first appeared in pregnancy. A routine blood test revealed
a high glucose reading. I was confused but told usually gestational diabetes
>>>>>>> In the last few months of pregnancy I was checking my blood sugar and
monitoring my carb intake. I then got told as my glucose tolerance test had
been so high (17mmol) I would need to start injecting insulin. I hated needles
and was incredibly upset. Not only did I have to learn to inject, I would have
to inject into my baby bump! Cue more tears! The first time I injected I was
stood in the kitchen crying and generally feeling very sorry for myself! In
fact after the first few injections, I was fine. I got used to it very
>>>>>>> Our first little girl Alice was born in March 2014. Over the next year
I believed my diabetes had gone, but then by the summer I was losing weight,
feeling shattered and noticing high blood sugar readings and thirst. I knew
something wasn't right. By December 2014 I was diagnosed with Type 2 and told
to watch my carb intake. I got to the stage where a sandwich would send my
blood sugar sky high. I virtually stopped eating carbs, scared about what they

first appointment at a new hospital, my (now) consultant took one look at me
and said she suspected I was Type 1. Antibody tests confirmed this was the

firstly exhausted relief – Type 1 made sense. I felt sad that life was to
change and this diagnosis would involve daily challenges and a lot of
organisation. My family have always been amazing and actively worked to
understand the condition. I'll be honest, some friends left me feeling
disappointed when I first told them, changing the subject and not taking the
time to try to understand what a life changing diagnosis it has been.
>>>>>>> After feeling a bit miserable to start with I decided to pick myself
up and try to understand as much as I could about Type 1. I pushed to get into
a DAFNE course as soon as possible and learning to carb count with the help of
my dietitian really turned things around for me. I learned to enjoy food again
and there's little I feel I can't eat now – I just need to know what to
inject. I test my blood sugar a lot but also now have a Freestyle Libre, a
>>>>>>> I've also embraced social media – there's a whole community out there
on Twitter and I often get answers to questions within minutes from fellow
Type 1s. I also signed up to Diabetes UK and look forward to the Balance
magazine dropping through the letterbox. I feel part of a community – it's not
ideal being Type 1, but surrounding myself with others who understand what
>>>>>>> Since my diagnosis two years ago, I've had my second daughter, Lara,
who has just turned 1. My HbA1c is at a good level, my hypos are minimal and
I've just been approved for a pump. It's a daily challenge, but one I'm
