# If sugar is so bad for us, why is the sugar in fruit OK?

We hear regularly from health organisations and experts that we should eat
less sugar. But we’re also told we should eat more fruit.
All types of sugar will give us the same amount of calories, whether they are
from fruit or soft drink. But the health risks of eating sugar are related to
consuming too many “free sugars” in the diet, not from eating sugars that are
Sugar in food and drinks comes in various forms. Sugar molecules are
classified as monosaccharides (single sugar molecules such as glucose and
fructose) and disaccharides (more complex structures such as sucrose and
Fruit contains natural sugars, which are a mix of sucrose, fructose and
glucose. Many people have heard that sugar is bad, and think that this must
But fructose is only harmful in excess amounts, and not when it comes from
fruit. It would be incredibly difficult to consume excessive amounts of
It’s much easier to consume excess sugar from foods and drinks that contain
Free sugars include these same sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose), but in
this case they have been removed from their naturally occurring source (rather
than being eaten as natural parts of fruits, dairy products, and some
vegetables and grains). This includes sugar that is added to food and drinks
## Health risks come from free sugars, not fruits
Evidence shows that the health risks from sugars, such as tooth decay and
unhealthy weight gain, are related to consuming too many free sugars in the
diet, not from eating sugars that are naturally present in fruits or milk.
For this reason it is recommended that no more than 10% of your daily calories
come from free sugars. For the average adult, this is about 50g or only
slightly more than the amount of sugar in a can of regular soft drink or soda.
It’s estimated that Australians get around 60% (65g) of their sugar intake
Foods that are sources of free sugars, such as juices, soft drinks, biscuits
and lollies, are often high in calories and have little other nutritional
value. It is often easy to consume more of them compared with fresh fruit and
they also may be replacing other nutritious foods in the diet.
Consider a bottle of fruit juice – you would have to eat six whole oranges to
get the same amount of sugar you consume in the juice. And because the fruit
is in juice form, it counts towards your daily limit of free sugars.
Calories from drinks that contain sugar often become an addition to the
calories you are eating from food, which may lead to weight gain over time.
Eating large amounts of dried fruit is also not a good idea if you are
limiting your sugar intake. Through the process of removing water from the
fruit, nutrients are concentrated, such that dried apricots, for example,
contain about six times as much sugar (40g per 100g) as fresh apricots (6g per
Unlike many foods that are high in free sugars, fruits are packaged with lots
of nutrients that help provide us with a balanced diet for good health.
For starters, fruit is an excellent source of fibre. An average banana will
provide 20-25% (6g) of your recommended daily fibre intake. Getting enough
fibre in the diet is important for protecting against bowel cancer. There is
clear room for improvement in our fibre intake – adults in many countries
consume only about half of the recommended amount each day (25g for Aussie
The fibre in fruit, which is often absent in many foods and drinks with free
sugars, may also help to fill you up, which means you eat less overall at a
meal. It’s not clear exactly why this is, but it could be related to the
volume of the food (especially compared with liquids) and the chewing
Fruit is also a good source of other nutrients such as potassium, which can
help lower blood pressure, and flavonoids, which may reduce your risk of heart
There is evidence that eating whole fruits (alone and in combination with
vegetables) reduces your chances of dying from cancer, obesity and heart
Despite this, only about 50% of Australians eat at least two pieces of fruit
Most national dietary guidelines encourage eating fruits and vegetables, with
an emphasis on the vegetables. To try and eat your recommended two pieces of
fruit per day remember that a piece could be a banana, apple or orange, or two
smaller fruits like plums or apricots, or a cup of grapes or berries.
When it comes to other sources of sugars, try to choose foods that have little
or no sugar listed in the ingredient list, and drink water instead of sugary
