* What should I do if I have pre-diabetes?

* Type 2 diabetes and me – online course
Here’s a fun activity to help keep your spirits up, reads one meme: Keep a
photo each week of your COVID-19 moustache and hold a competition with your
friends to see who has the best one.
One woman responded: Can we ask our husbands to join too?
These are dark days but there’s always something to laugh about.
There is the video of a young man being told he has two options in case of a
lockdown: Option A is isolating with his wife and child. “OPTION B” he yells
quickly, before he even knows what it is.
There’s also a rumour that parents will find a cure for COVID-19 before
scientists now that most children are home from school.
And then there are the friends who say they went into isolation looking like
their own version of Jennifer Aniston but will emerge closer to Gandalf from
Lord of the Rings with flowing locks of white hair.
Let’s be honest. If that’s the worst that will happen, we’re very lucky
This will be an Easter like no other, and it’s a time when members of our
We still don’t know a lot about this relatively new virus and how it affects
The good news from Italy and China is that children and adolescents under 16
years of age who are living with type 1 diabetes are are not showing a
different disease pattern and there have been no cases of COVID-19 in youth
with diabetes requiring hospitalisation. Initial reports make the medical

hands, stay at a safe distance, and stay at home unless you’re seeing a doctor
Try to get a friend or relative to deliver your groceries.
But don’t delay speaking with your doctor if you have concerns about your
diabetes. There is information that children are presenting with diabetic
ketoacidosis in greater numbers in Italy as their parents didn’t want to take
them to a doctor for fear of contracting the virus.
Remember, there are risks to our wellbeing other than COVID-19.
Also remember that despite Italy facing a terrible toll, they have not faced
any toilet paper shortages. “We think it must be an Anglo-Saxon thing,” one
man outside Milan laughed. Why was it that we feared running out of toilet
Then there’s the bright young thing who stuck a sticker on their sock to look
like an eye, moulded the sock to their hand, and took it to the window to
present a “monster” eating passing cars. It doesn’t sound like much, but
And maybe that’s the best we can do at the moment.
Happy Easter, friends. If it’s not, remember that there are happier and easier
