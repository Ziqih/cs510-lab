# Coping with caring for a child with type 1 diabetes
### Diabetes affects everyone differently, but it also affects the people
Caring for your child with type 1 diabetes can have a positive and worthwhile
impact on your life, but this doesn’t mean you don’t need support sometimes
A lot of people don’t see themselves as a carer of their child – they’re just
doing their job as a parent or guardian. Many people think that they’re doing
what anyone would for a person they love, but a carer is anyone who looks
You shouldn’t feel guilty admitting that caring for a child with diabetes can
put a lot of pressure on you, your relationships and your finances. Opening up
about being a carer can help you can get the support and help you need, and
also help other people in the same situation. Here's Sue doing just that.
## Your reaction when your child is newly diagnosed
It can often come as a shock when your child is diagnosed with diabetes.
A lot of parents feel guilty when they find out their child has diabetes, but
it isn’t your fault. Genetics play a small part in why a child might develop
type 1, but there are a lot of other factors too that we’re not sure of yet.
This means we’re still not completely sure why people get type 1. If you're
new to diabetes, there is lots of practical information and support available
Most people who look after a child with diabetes don’t know anything about it
before diagnosis. But your healthcare team is there to help you. Don’t be
afraid to ask them questions and ask for support, you need to understand what
diabetes is and how to look after it too.
It’s okay to feel sad, angry and overwhelmed at the start because you might
have to make a lot of lifestyle changes too.
If you’re coming to terms with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, it’s normal
that this can take a long time. Don’t force yourself to stop dealing with the
different emotions that it can cause, but let yourself work through these at
your own pace. It might help to separate the physical act of looking after

When you’re caring for a child with diabetes, it can often feel like you have
to take around the clock responsibility for them. But it’s important to look
after yourself too, this can be restarting or starting a new hobby, seeing
If you’re looking after a child with type 1, getting enough sleep can be hard.
You might not be if you’re doing nightly blood sugar checks, or just up
But getting enough sleep is really important for your mental and physical
health. If you can share night-time responsibility with your partner or
someone else, try and come up with a way of alternating night-time
If your child is having a lot of night-time highs and lows, make sure you
speak to your child’s healthcare team about what you can do. They might
It’s important to still feel like an individual while you’re caring for your
child. This can be difficult, especially if you’re having to make big
If your friends have been a bit distant, this isn’t always because they don’t
want to help you, it’s probably that they don’t know how. Remember that type 1
diabetes isn’t that common, so it’s likely that this is the first time they’ve
It can be hard to make the first move, but sometimes you have too. Let them
know if you’re comfortable with them asking questions, explain what diabetes
is, how it’s affected things at home, and how they can help you.
Looking after someone with diabetes and helping manage it can leave you
emotionally and physically exhausted. Finding people who are also looking
after a child with diabetes can really help you cope. They’ll understand, and
be able to offer you support when you need it the most.
Sharing your experiences and talking to people who know exactly what’s it’s
like can be really useful for emotional support.
A good way of getting in touch with other parents or carers is through our
local groups or on our online forum. We’ve got dedicated boards for parents
that are some of our most active boards so you can chat and meet other
We also run family weekenders, where you can meet other families who have type
1 diabetes. These weekends are made up of a number of sessions that can offer
you support and help you create a new group of friends.
When you’re looking after a child with diabetes, your relationships with other
family members can sometimes be put on the backburner. Caring for a child with
type 1 takes loads of energy. This can mean putting in effort with other
people can sometimes be difficult, especially if you’re stressed, tired and
If you have a partner, don’t feel guilty about putting each other first
sometimes. Try to find someone who can help you, like a babysitter or a
grandparent who knows what your child needs. This means you can both go out
and spend quality time together without worrying as much. But we know this is
hard so even something small like bringing your partner a cup of tea can show
It’s important to remember that you are different people and you will deal
with situations differently, and that includes looking after your child. This
could be that one of you might find accepting a diabetes diagnosis more
difficult or learning carb counting is easier for one of you. It’s easy to get
annoyed with each other if this happens, but try to remember you’re both under
the same pressure and that this often affects your moods.
This is normal and being there to support each other will help you both, and
Feeling like you’re missing out and feeling guilty about not spending enough
Having quality time with your other children is important so you can make sure
If you have someone that can look after your child with diabetes, making some
time for you and your other children is a really good way of making them feel
Do something together that you’ll both enjoy that can get you out of the
house. This will help you focus on your other children so you can make sure
they’re getting the support and time they need.
You might want to include your children without diabetes with different bits
of your diabetes routine. This doesn’t mean they should take on any
responsibility of their sibling, but helping with some day-to-day activities
like cooking will help them feel involved. Doing something small like cooking
together a couple of times a week can be a fun way to spend time together as a
family. It also allows your other children to ask questions, learn more about
It’s important to recognise that your child’s siblings might feel like that
should take on some responsibility for looking after their brother or sister.
If this is the case, make sure they don’t feel they have to and they have time
## Juggling your career and being a carer
Looking after a child with diabetes and working can sometimes feel like having
a full-time job. Having a job is often really important to a lot of people
because it gives you a separate identity, can add to your own self-esteem and
If you’re struggling to keep a balance between your job and looking after your
child, speak to your employer as soon as possible. They’ll be able to talk you
through the different things they might be able to do to support you.
You legally have the right to request flexible working hours once in every 12
months or ask emergency time off if you need it. If you’re formally requesting
flexible working hours make sure you’re being clear that you’re making a
Your employer can only deny a request if they have a good business reason to
say no, but they have to offer you the ability to appeal this decision.
If you’re worried and need extra help financially, you might be able to get
help from the government. Find out more about Disability Living Allowance and
## Letting go of managing your child’s care
