Following bouts of rubella and tonsillitis I was officially diagnosed with
diabetes in 1974 when I was four years old. At the time I didn’t know what was
happening – my little fingers were being cut to pieces for blood tests and my
urine tested for sugar levels. Thankfully things are much better today with
more accurate testing and better technology. Once I left the hospital I went
back to school but I always felt my health was a burden to my parents and
older sister but I wouldn’t be here today without them!
I was a straight A student at school and despite the teasing – kids used to
call me pin cushion and the teachers had no idea how to handle my condition –
I did well. I decided diabetes wasn’t going to stop me and I went on to study
fashion design. I am a single mum after having had two healthy, natural
I have been through plenty of health scares and discrimination issues. In 2012
I was going through a Workers Compensation Claim and being bullied at work
when the stress became too much and I ended up going into a diabetic coma. I
was at home, dying in front of my two girls. Thankfully Carmen, who was eight
at the time, saved my life. I also went on to win my court case and prove that
my Carpal Tunnel Syndrome was not caused by my diabetes. I am currently
wrapping up a discrimination case with the Human Rights Commission against my
former employer for terminating my 20+ years employment due to my condition. I
have been through a lot of discrimination but I am rising above it! I am
strong minded, passionate and determined to help others living with diabetes.
Let’s help educate Australia and businesses about diabetes and raise more
awareness on insulin pumps, health eating and how to turn negatives into
positives. I am passionate about supporting others and inspiring them to stand
up for their rights and enjoy their lives. Living with diabetes is not all
