When kind people like you donate to Diabetes NSW & ACT you are helping to
ensure no-one has to deal with diabetes alone.
Thanks to your generosity, we can deliver advocacy support, psychological care
and up to date expert advice to people living with diabetes. All while
challenging public perceptions about diabetes and searching for better
When you consider that people living with diabetes are two to three times more
likely than the general population to suffer from depression, having access to
psychological care is critical to their health and wellbeing.
That’s why we have a Psychologist on Call - for people who are experiencing,
or at risk of, mental health issues like diabetes distress and depression.
The service provides specialist psychological support to people living with
diabetes, their families and carers. The psychologist also provides advice to
allied health professionals like dietitians and diabetes educators – including
our own staff – so they are better equipped to help their patients too.
Tasnia, who lives with type 1 diabetes, welcomed the news that our
Psychologist on Call is on hand to help people by phone or email.
 _“Unfortunately, educators and dietitians don’t have the time to talk to you
about your mental health issues. You can feel so alone. So it’s really
important as a person with diabetes to be able to check in with a psychologist
Diabetes NSW & ACT lobbies governments to draw attention to barriers that
people living with diabetes can face in their personal and business lives.
Our policy and advocacy team works on individual complaints and common
problems people living with diabetes routinely face. For example, hospital
rules that prevent self-care of diabetes which can put people’s health in
One of the calls to our Helpline was from the husband of a woman whose
diabetes was not managed well in hospital. He told us,
 _“She wasn’t allowed to inject her own insulin. It wasn’t being given at the
right time. Her blood glucose levels weren’t being tested often enough. She
collapsed because she wasn’t getting her meds on time. They’ve had to rush her
When someone from our diabetes community comes to us with stories of diabetes
management Rebekah Henricksen, our Policy and Advocacy Manager, is the person
Here is what Rebekah says about her work and its importance for our community,
 _“When a person is diagnosed with diabetes, they are diagnosed with a health
issue. But what they are often faced with is a lot of non-health issues that
surround their diabetes. Diabetes is hard enough to manage without the
additional difficulties of discrimination, access to services, increased
bureaucratic hurdles, isolation, and prejudice. When a person contacts us
about one of these issues, we help them through an individual problem._
 _But, if we have many people contacting us about the same issue, we know that
there is something wrong in the system that is making life harder for people
living with diabetes. We will then use the experience of these people to try
to change the system and make life a little bit easier for other people living
Diabetes NSW & ACT supports and develops outstanding diabetes research to help
find better treatments and a possible cure so that future generations can live
a life free from diabetes and its complications.
Each year we award grants to a range of research projects focused on studies
across the spectrum of diabetes prevention, management and finding a cure.
 _“Our research can only make progress if funding is provided to help us. My
own lab is totally dependent on grant funding. Your donations are absolutely
critical to finding better treatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. On
behalf of all diabetes researchers, I sincerely thank you and assure you that
without your continued support, we cannot make the discoveries that will
ultimately translate to a better, healthier lifestyle for people with
The DiRECT study, funded by Diabetes UK, has demonstrated for the first time
that remission of type 2 diabetes is possible and the long held view of
diabetes being a ‘life sentence’ isn’t necessarily accurate.
The results of the DiRECT study are extremely encouraging which is why we are
looking to establish the Australian T2 Remission Project. The purpose of the
project will be to demonstrate that an intensive, supported, weight loss
program can lead to the remission of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes NSW & ACT
believes that if the same results are achieved in Australia as in the UK, then
the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the longer term health of the country
will be transformed. That’s why we want to conduct the study in Australia.
 _“This ground-breaking research has major implications for Australia both for
the health of people with type 2 diabetes and the cost savings achievable, if
we can replicate this study and deliver comparable results,”_ said T2
 _“Securing the funding to run this project will give new hope to people
living with type 2 diabetes and a life without the complications of diabetes
for many. Even if remission isn’t achieved, participants who lose weight can
expect to lower their blood pressure and cholesterol, need fewer medications,
and enjoy a higher quality of life – all of which benefit, the individual,
