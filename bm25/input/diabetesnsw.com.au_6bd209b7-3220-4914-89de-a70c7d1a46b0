# Nano capsules effective in treating type 2
Curtin University researchers have developed tiny nano capsules that are able
to effectively target the liver and pancreas reducing the inflammatory effects
The research, recently published in the Nature journal, explored whether the
tiny capsules, developed using bio-nanotechnologies and filled with a
combination of human-based bile acids and the lipid-lowering drug Probucol,
could target the inflammatory effects of diabetes in mouse models over a six
Lead author Dr Hani Al-Salami, from the Curtin Health Innovation Research
Institute (CHIRI) and the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, said the
tiny capsules were designed to preferentially target specific organs and
enhance the delivery of the active agents, reducing potential damage to other
“Using advanced and customisable bio-nanotechnologies, our team was able to
generate tiny capsules that protected the active drugs during the digestive
and absorptive process, which in turn enhanced uptake of bile acids and
Probucol in the liver and pancreas, which are typically inflamed in diabetes,”
“We found that the nano particles containing bile acids and Probucol were
effective in reducing high-blood sugar levels and diabetes-associated
inflammation in animal models with type 2 diabetes.”
Dr Al-Salami explained that the research findings showed great promise for
future treatments for diabetes, but further research was needed to test
whether the treatment could also be effective in humans.
“Our study showed a promising link between the use of bio-nanotechnology and
tissue-targeted delivery in diabetic models. By using these advanced
technologies, it may be possible to reduce the progression and severity of
