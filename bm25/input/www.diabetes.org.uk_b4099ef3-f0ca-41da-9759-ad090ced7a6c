There’s nothing like a slice of cake on your birthday. Have a small piece of
your favourite kind, or use these swaps for a healthier version.
* Use edible inks to print photos onto rice paper or thin icing sheets to personalise birthday cakes.
* Add a design by using a stencil and a dusting of icing sugar and/or cocoa. If you’re buying a cake with fondant, taking this off your slice before you eat it saves you some sugar and calories.
* Decorate with colourful fruit, or make a statement with indoor fireworks.
* Add a wide ribbon to the side of the cake, instead of icing – this will cut back on sugar and produce an elegant looking cake.
* Stick with a thin layer of jam inside the cake, rather than buttercream or cream.
* Fruit cakes and carrot cakes call for less added sugar in their recipes, but keep an eye on extras like icing and toppings, so it doesn’t end up with the same calories as other cakes.
* Make a square cake that will be easier to cut into more even, slightly smaller portions.
