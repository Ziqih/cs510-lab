Caring for your feet is an important part of looking after your diabetes.
Diabetes can increase the risk of problems with your feet, so regular check-
ups with your diabetes team or podiatrist is important.
##**What can I do to look after my feet?**
Sometimes we forget about our feet. We need to wash, dry and moisturise our
feet every day. Here are some helpful tips that you can practise at home to
* Dry your feet well, paying particular attention to between the toes – moisture trapped in between the toes can lead to skin breakdown and infection
* Moisturise your feet daily – do not apply creams in between your toes, this area needs to be kept dry
* Look after your toenails – cut your nails straight across and gently file any rough edges. If your nails have thickened, see a podiatrist
* Wear the correct foot wear – enclosed shoes are best that have adjustable fastening devices such as laces, Velcro or buckles. Enclosed shoes help prevent dry, cracked heels and protect the whole foot from injury
* Make sure your shoes fits well, be sure they don’t cause blisters or rubbing and have a small heel height of less than 2cm
##**What are the complications I might see in my feet from diabetes?**
Diabetes can affect the blood flow and nerves to your feet.
* Do not have any nerve damage – burning, tingling or numb areas of the feet
* Do not have any changes to the shape of your feet or changes to the skin colour – such as bright red or mottled
* Nerve damage: numbness, tingling or burning sensations
* Changes to the shape or colour of your feet
It is important to have your feet checked regularly by a health professional.
A podiatrist is a health professional that specialise in looking after feet.
* Have your feet checked at least once per year
* Have your feet checked at least every 6 months
* There is any sign of infection, skin breakdown, ulcer or cracking skin
* There is new pain, swelling or redness, especially if you have nerve damage
