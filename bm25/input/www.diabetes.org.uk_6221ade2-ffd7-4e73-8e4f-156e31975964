We've created this information for people living with diabetes and their
families. We hope you find it useful and it answers some of your questions.

All the information below applies to the whole of the UK, unless specified.
We've noted where are some differences in guidance and diabetes services
## Shielding – advice for clinically extremely vulnerable people
Shielding is a way of protecting 'clinically extremely vulnerable' people who
are at a very high risk of severe illness and needing to go to hospital if
they catch coronavirus. It means staying at home almost all of the time, with
Diabetes is not in the clinically extremely vulnerable group (shielding group)
– it is in the 'clinically vulnerable group' – so having diabetes doesn’t
automatically mean you need to shield. Although there may be some people with
diabetes who need to shield based on other conditions or other risk factors,
for example those with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. This means that for
most people with diabetes, any lockdown rules where you live are the same for
you as they are for people who don’t have diabetes.
**We are calling on the government to urgentlyadd some people with diabetes to
While we wait for the government to respond to our call, if you think you are
in this high risk group and that you should be on the shielding list, you can
call our helpline for more advice. Email us at helpline@diabetes.org.uk or

## How coronavirus can affect people with diabetes
If you have diabetes – regardless of what type you have – you are no more
likely to catch coronavirus than anyone else. And the majority of people who
do get coronavirus – whether they have diabetes or not – will have mild
symptoms and don’t need to go into hospital.
However everyone with diabetes, including those with type 1, type 2,
gestational and other types, is more vulnerable to developing a severe illness
if they do get coronavirus, but the way it affects you can vary from person to
person. In children, the risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus is
For most adults, coronavirus is a mild illness. But some people develop a more
serious illness and sadly could die. Research shows us that there are certain
risk factors that make people with diabetes at higher risk, like being older,
having a high HbA1c, or having a history of diabetes-related complications.
There are other factors too, like your BMI and ethnicity, that research shows
There are some risk factors that you can't change, but others where you can
Being ill can make your blood sugar go all over the place. Your body tries to
fight the illness by releasing stored glucose (sugar) into your blood stream
to give you energy. But your body can’t produce enough or any insulin to cope
Your body is working overtime to fight the illness, making it harder to manage
your diabetes. This means you’re more at risk of having serious blood sugar
highs and lows, potentially leading to DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) or HHS
## How to reduce your risk of getting seriously ill from coronavirus
The UK government is reviewing lockdown restrictions for the UK on a regular
basis, and there are different rules for different areas. You can find out
more about the rules in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but
* wash hands regularly, for 20 seconds 
* stay 2 meters away from people outside your household.
The most important way people living with diabetes can lower their risk of
becoming seriously ill from coronavirus is to avoid catching the virus in the
first place. A vaccine is the most effective way to prevent infection, and
that’s why we strongly encourage you to get the vaccine when you’re offered
We’ve got more information about the coronavirus vaccines, including the
latest results from the trials and guidance about when people with diabetes
Some of you have been asking us whether people with diabetes need to wear face
masks and coverings. Some research shows that they can slow the spread of the
virus, by protecting others from catching something you may be carrying. This
is true for everyone, including people with diabetes.
Get one of our adjustable face coverings from our online shop.
There are certain reasons why some people don’t need to wear a face covering –
called exemptions. These include children (depending on their age), if you
have asthma, and lots more. But these exemptions are different depending on
where you live, so check your national government websites for the most up-to-
date list – we've added some useful links below. If these exemptions apply to
you, then you don’t need to wear one. But if nothing on the list applies to
you, then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t wear a face covering.
We know it’s not that simple. Wearing a mask can take some getting used to,
and can feel very strange at first. Some of you have told us that wearing a
mask makes you feel anxious or you find it hard to breathe. There are lots of
different masks out there so try to find one that suits you best. You also
could try wearing it around the house for a bit, to get used to breathing in
If you spot someone not wearing a mask when they’re out and about, try not to
make a judgement – there could be lots of invisible reasons for this and it’s
not something that’s in your control. Some people may prefer to have something
to hand that says they don't need to wear a face covering. You can print these
from the UK Government website or make the message your phone screensaver.
Research has shown that having a high HbA1c can increase your risk of becoming
seriously ill from coronavirus. So it’s important to work with your diabetes
team to try to bring your blood sugar levels to a healthy range.
We've explored some of the research behind reducing your risk, including
If you do get coronavirus, it’s really important that you follow your sick day
rules. This will help you to keep your blood sugars in range as much as
possible, so you can stay well and fight the virus. We know it’s not that
always that simple. Take a look at our new courses in Learning Zone to help
you remember your sick day rules and manage your blood sugar levels, and our
Some people are being treated for coronavirus with a steroid called
dexamethasone, which can make your blood sugars go high. Find out more about

### How coronavirus can affect children with diabetes
Although children can catch the virus, they normally have very mild symptoms
and we are not aware of any children with diabetes who have died from
coronavirus. However, as with all people with diabetes, an illness like
coronavirus can make it harder to manage your child’s diabetes and they still
have a risk of DKA. So it's important that you make sure your child follows
social distancing and handwashing recommendations to reduce their risk of
### How coronavirus can affect pregnant women with diabetes
The same rules apply to you as for everyone with diabetes. If you’re pregnant
and have diabetes, then you are not more at risk of getting the virus.
However, if you do get the virus, you could be more at risk of developing
complications and it could become harder to manage your diabetes. For that
reason, it's really important you're extra careful and follow social
You can find all the latest information for pregnant women from the Royal
### How coronavirus can affect people in type 2 diabetes remission
Diabetes remission works differently for different people, and we still don't
know enough about it. So we don't know for sure how the virus could affect you
if you’re in remission. Everyone, including people in diabetes remission,
should carefully follow social distancing rules. You can find more general
information in our guide to type 2 diabetes remission.
### How coronavirus can affect people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic
The risk of death from coronavirus for some ethnic groups is higher than for
people of white ethnicity. But it is important to remember that there are lots
of factors involved, like age, and overall risk of dying from coronavirus is
In England and Wales, data from the Office of National Statistics shows how
people from certain Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are more at
risk than people of white ethnicity. Research in Scotland hasn’t shown this
increased risk, but the BAME population there is very small. And we don’t have
data on this in Northern Ireland at the moment.
![Data from Office of National Statistics. Covid-19 deaths by ethnicity in
England and Wales between 2 March and 10 April 2020.](https://diabetes-
Data from Office of National Statistics. Covid-19 deaths by ethnicity in
England and Wales between 2 March and 10 April 2020.
We don’t know why this is happening. The data takes into account factors which
we know can increase risk, such as age, socioeconomic status and health,
including obesity. And we do know that some ethnic minority groups are more at
risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart problems, which
are linked to increased risk of death from coronavirus.
It’s clear that we need further research to understand what’s causing this –
whether the causes are physical, cultural or social. We are pushing for
clearer guidance from the government on risks to people from ethnic minority
Data from NHS England in May showed us that, for those who become so unwell
with coronavirus that they need to go to hospital, the risk of dying is higher
for people living with diabetes than people without the condition. But the
risks aren't the same for everyone with diabetes. Most deaths have been in the
elderly with very few under the age of 50 and none in children.
This study only looked at the number of people who have died in hospital as a
result of coronavirus. It doesn’t include information on the many thousands
who have recovered at home or who have been successfully discharged from
hospital. We are calling on the government and NHS to ensure this data is used
to update guidance and policies to keep people who are at greatest risk
protected and supported. Research has shown us that people with diabetes who
have the highest risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from coronavirus are
those over the age of 50, who have a high HbA1c (above 75mmol/mol or 9%) and
Here our Head of Research Communications, Dr Lucy Chambers, explains more
about the risk factors, including type of diabetes, age and ethnicity, and why
for most people your risk of dying remains very low. Although this research is
England based, we believe this level of risk will be true in all nations. And
to find out more detail on these statistics, go to our coronavirus deaths in
We’re funding research projects looking at the specific ways coronavirus
affects people living with diabetes. We know there’s a lot more to learn about
this new type of virus, and we know we need answers fast.
The government advice is that people should work from home if possible. If
you're not able to work from home and still need to go to your workplace, your
employer needs to take the right steps to make the workplace safe, to minimise
In some areas of the UK, some people who are clinically extremely vulnerable
are being advised to stay at home even if they can't work from home.
**We are calling on the government to urgentlyadd some people with diabetes to
### If you can’t work from home and have diabetes
Your employer must make sure your workplace is safe – this means doing a risk
assessment at work. We know that some people with diabetes don't feel safe
going back to work, so we're pushing the government on making it safer.
Some people with diabetes are classed as clinically extremely vulnerable and
there are different rules on this depending where you live. This means some
people may qualify for a furlough scheme or things like sick pay – take a look
at our section on shielding for information based on where you live.
We've got more information about your rights in our diabetes and work guide.
### If you can’t work from home and have a child with diabetes
Similarly to a workplace assessment, your child's school must do a risk
assessment at school when they reopen. Some schools may remain open for
children of key workers. We've got more information on children and school
### If you’re a parent with diabetes working at home
We know some of you are worried about your child bringing the virus home from
school when they reopen, and that’s understandable. Use our quick and easy
Learning Zone coronavirus course to learn how to keep yourself well. And make
sure you know what your child's school should be doing about maintaining

Everyone, including children with diabetes, can get coronavirus. The rules
about on social distancing and hand washing apply to children with diabetes
Schools should be practicing social distancing for your child when schools
reopen. This is to prevent the virus from spreading between children and your
home. We know this is easier said than done, and can depend on how old your
child is and the size of the school.
You may be worried about whether it is safe for your child to go to school if
they have diabetes. Speak to the school when it reopens and to your child’s
diabetes team about your concerns. And read our guide for parents on what you
should expect from your child's school – including doing a risk assessment and
While the risk of children with diabetes becoming seriously ill with
coronavirus is very low, we’ve been in touch with the Department for Education
to raise your concerns and ask that when their school-specific guidance is
published – it includes guidance on supporting children with health conditions
If you have coronavirus symptoms, do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or
If you're already having treatment for something like a foot or eye problem,
and you don't have coronavirus symptoms, then your appointments should still
carry on. If you're worried about going to your clinic or hospital at this
time or want to check whether your appointment is still going ahead, call the
number on your appointment letter or speak to your GP.
It's likely that most appointments with your diabetes healthcare team will be
on the phone or online, using a video call. There are some groups of people
who need to be seen face-to-face more than others at the moment. Your diabetes
healthcare team will give you advice on the best type of appointment for you
at this time. Having a phone or video appointment might feel strange if you're
not used to it but we've got advice on preparing for a remote appointments.
Most routine appointments like your annual diabetes review have been delayed
or postponed. But you should be able to reschedule once things go back to
normal. In the meantime, follow your current routine including checking your
feet daily, keep to a healthy diet and try to keep active. Eye screening is
still going ahead in some circumstances and for some people who are at higher
risk of problems, such as pregnant women with diabetes. All eye screening
clinics should be using personal protective equipment (PPE).
And remember to get your free flu jab as early as possible. Speak to your GP
or go to your local pharmacy. Find out more about the flu jab.
If you are invited to an in-person appointment it’s very important to attend
unless you develop coronavirus symptoms. This is to make sure you stay as
healthy as possible during the pandemic. Health professionals will be wearing

If you spot something new you're concerned about, like a cut or blister on
your foot, call your GP and explain your situation. If you can't get through,
call 111 for advice. If you have any change in your vision you should contact
You may be in a situation where you need medical attention – this may be
something related to your diabetes, or it may be something unrelated like an
injury or illness. This means you might have to go to the Accident and
Emergency (A&E) department of your local hospital and you might have to wait a
During this time, your care in hospital may be a little different to normal,
for example you may not see the diabetes team or not have family with you when
you go into hospital. For any problem, regardless of the current situation,
you should go to hospital as you would've done before – the NHS is still open.
Read our guide to managing your diabetes while in hospital.
The new guidance from government has placed additional restrictions on travel.
These restrictions differ depending the current level of alert where you live,
and so we recommend you check the appropriate guidance before travelling.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office currently advises British nationals
against all but essential international travel. Check the UK government site
for all the latest updates on where and when you can travel. You could also
check the TravelHealthPro website for the latest travel health guidance.

We know some people have had challenges getting access to food deliveries and
the food you need to stay healthy. We have written to the major supermarkets
You’ve also been asking about medicines and diabetes technology. There is no
need for the public or NHS to stockpile insulin, diabetes medicines or tech.
This could cause shortages and put other patients at risk. Pharmacies have
been asked to not support patients trying to stockpile. Get more info about
The government has been working with industry and partners to monitor the
impact of coronavirus on the UK supply chain of medicines and technology and
put in place measures to protect UK patients. This includes banning companies
from buying medicines like insulin that are meant for UK patients and selling
on for a higher price in another country. This will help to ensure an
uninterrupted supply of crucial medicines like insulin for NHS hospitals
We want to reassure you that if you’re using an insulin pump, a continuous
glucose monitor or a flash glucose monitor (a FreeStyle Libre), you will still
be able to get these – whether that’s usually through prescriptions or you pay
for these yourself. And if your insulin pump warranty is due to expire soon,
the companies who make these will extend this or supply a replacement if
For those who need or choose to buy test strips, we have negotiated with
several companies to make certain strips available through our catalogue and
We know some people have had challenges getting access to food deliveries and
the food you need to stay healthy. If you live in an area which is in Tier 3
or Tier 4 restrictions, and you are shielding, you can register for support to
get priority deliveries. Given the extra demand supermarkets face in the
Christmas period, priority deliveries are not currently guaranteed, so you may
find it easier to order your shopping delivery as you would normally.
If you have not been told to shield, or you live in an area that isn’t in Tier
3 or Tier 4 restrictions, you should contact your local council. They may be
able to offer support to help you get the food you need. You can also contact
NHS Volunteer Responders, who can arrange for a volunteer to deliver your
Pharmacies are working hard to make sure that everyone with diabetes gets the
medicines they need. Help them to help you by following these tips:
* Follow government advice and don't go to a pharmacy if you or anyone in your household has a temperature or a new and continuous cough, even if mild. Some organisations like Boots pharmacy have an online service and are encouraging customers to choose for their medicines to be delivered to their homes – you don't have to sign for these now, the delivery driver will leave the package somewhere safe and let you know.
* Plan ahead where possible. Our advice is to try and order your next prescription at least 14 days before it is due. 
* Put your contact details on prescriptions so pharmacies can let you know when your medicines are ready, so you won’t need to be in the pharmacy for as long. Please don’t ring the pharmacy unless it’s urgent.
* If you're self-isolating, see if family, friends or neighbours can pick up your medication for you. If you don’t have anyone who can collect your medicine, speak to your community pharmacy for advice about how they can help. There might be community or voluntary groups ready to help in your area.
* If you're well and can visit the pharmacy yourself, think about how you can help family, friends and neighbours who are self-isolating by collecting their medicines on their behalf (you may need to take ID with you and will need to know the name and address of the person you are collecting for).
* Don't ask for extra medicine. Continue to get medicines as normal and don't stockpile.
* Ask your prescriber about electronic repeat dispensing, so you can order your repeat prescriptions online.
We know some people may not have friends and family able to help while they
are isolated at home. You may be able to get help from voluntary groups in
your area or your local councils or local authorities. Check your government
