250ml chicken stock (using half stock cube and 250ml water)
1. Add the olive oil to a saucepan on a medium heat, then add the chopped onion. Stir regularly for 8 minutes until brown.
2. Now add the chicken and the baby onions and stir until they start to brown. Add the mushrooms and stir for another couple of minutes.
3. Add the thyme, bay leaf, garlic and pepper. Mix well and add the wine and stock. Bring to the boil, cover, then simmer gently for 1 hour.
4. Once the chicken has cooked, check the sauce and season if needed. Finally, add the cornflour and water mixture and stir in for 3–5 minutes until the sauce thickens a little. Serve.
* This can be made a day or two in advance and kept in the fridge, which actually improves the flavour.
* If you don't have wine, you could use cider or add some more stock. However, if you add more stock, remember that this will increase the salt content of the recipe.
* This recipe will warm you up on a cold winter's day and is great served with crusty bread or mashed potato.
* Freezing instructions: Suitable for freezing once cooked. Defrost in the fridge and reheat until piping hot throughout.
