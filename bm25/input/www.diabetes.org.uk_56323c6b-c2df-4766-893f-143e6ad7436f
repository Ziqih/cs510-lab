Find out what stress is, how it affects diabetes and what you can do to change
Stress is how your body and mind reacts to new or difficult situations. It
might be something short-term like worrying about a presentation you’re giving
at work the next day. Or going to a party where you don’t know many people at
the weekend. It can also be something physical like an accident or illness.
Or you may have less immediate but more constant worries about things like
money, a relationship or coping with the loss of someone close.
Stress can affect you physically, emotionally and mentally.
If you’re feeling stressed, your body releases stress hormones like cortisol
and adrenaline. This should give you an energy boost for a ‘fight or flight’
response. But the hormones actually make it harder for insulin to work
properly, known as insulin resistance. As energy can’t get into your cells,
If your blood sugar levels go too high, it’s called going hyper (full name
hyperglycaemia). We’ve got more information about hypers, how to avoid them
If stress doesn’t go away, it can keep your blood sugar levels high and put
you at higher risk of diabetes complications. It can also affect your mood and
how you look after yourself, which can start to affect your emotional health.
But there are things you can do to take the pressure off.
Diabetes is often a cause of stress, particularly in the early days when
you’ve just been diagnosed. Having to pay close to attention to what you eat
and having lots of new things to learn and remember can feel tough. It may
mean you now have to check your blood sugar levels a lot or inject yourself
every day. Worrying about what the results will say or feeling anxious about
Some people with diabetes worry about having hypos too – when your blood sugar
level goes too low. It can be stressful wondering when they might happen and
managing them when they do. You might hear this called hypo anxiety and there
are things you can do to manage these feelings.
From time to time some people may start to feel overwhelmed by their diabetes,
feeling frustrated and distressed about having it. Some people worry about
getting complications and some feel guilty if the way they manage their
diabetes goes off track. This feeling of being overwhelmed can also get worse
when you’re feeling a lot of stress, when looking after your diabetes as well
It’s understandable if you feel this way from time to time – it’s known as
diabetes distress and you’re not alone. If you don’t manage this distress,
things can get worse and could lead to burnout. So talk to your healthcare
Stress alone doesn’t cause diabetes. But there is some evidence that there may
be a link between stress and the risk of Type 2 diabetes.
Our researchers think that high levels of stress hormones might stop insulin-
producing cells in the pancreas from working properly and reduce the amount of
insulin they make. In turn, this might contribute to the development of Type 2

At times of stress, it’s even more important to remember to look after
But we know it’s not always as easy as that. If you’re extra busy at work or
looking after family then forgetting to eat or take medication can happen.
It’s important to get a balance between looking after yourself without putting
too much pressure on yourself to do everything perfectly. This can add or lead
to stress. But it’s good to be aware of how easy it can be to give into the
habit of letting diabetes self-care slip in times of stress.
Getting enough sleep and building exercise, rest and relaxation time into your
routine helps some people cope better with stress.
"When things get hard, I usually go into self-care over drive. If too many
hypos are throwing me off, I'll hole up on the sofa with blankets and some
