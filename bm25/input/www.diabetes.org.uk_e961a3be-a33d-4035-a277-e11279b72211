>>>>>>> ### There isn’t a cure for diabetes right now.
>>>>>>> But our scientists across the UK are pushing boundaries and taking
steps to build a future where diabetes can do no harm. Here are some of the
ways we’re trying to achieve this goal for both Type 1 and Type 2.
>>>>>>> In Type 1 diabetes, insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas are
destroyed by the immune system. This means you can’t make the insulin you need
>>>>>>> To stop Type 1 diabetes we need to disrupt the immune system’s attack
on beta cells. And our scientists are working on it. They’re aiming to develop
and test treatments – called immunotherapies – that target the immune system
>>>>>>> This means in the future we could stop people from ever developing
>>>>>>> In people who are at high risk of getting Type 1 diabetes,
immunotherapies tested in trials have been able to delay the onset of the
condition for a few months. Scientists are now exploring whether giving
treatments earlier on, in younger children, could have better success at
>>>>>>> Immunotherapies also have potential to help people newly diagnosed
with Type 1 diabetes. Researchers hope to be able to slow down or halt the
immune attack to protect surviving beta cells. And it seems they might be able
to, at least in the short-term. Treatments that have been tested so far can
preserve the amount of insulin people make and improve their blood glucose
control. But the protective effects appear to dwindle over time.
>>>>>>> Work is now being done to look at how we can combine immunotherapies
to target different parts of the immune system, and have a greater impact.
>Find out more about how immunotherapies work and our research in this area.
>>>>>>> For people already living with Type 1 diabetes, a cure is likely to
>>>>>>> First, we need to replace the beta cells that have been destroyed by
the immune system, so people with Type 1 diabetes can make enough of their own
>>>>>>> Transplants using cells taken from donors already exist. But they stop
working over time and there are a limited number of donated pancreases
available. So scientists are trying to make an unlimited supply of beta cells
>>>>>>> Lab-made cells have already been implanted into animals and shown to
successfully treat their Type 1 diabetes, but we don’t know how lasting the
>>>>>>> More recently, researchers in Canada and USA moved into testing the
transplants in people with Type 1 diabetes. They’ve shown transplants are
safe, and trials are underway right now to see if they can improve the amount
of insulin people with Type 1 diabetes make. This is a really exciting
milestone, but there’s still a way to go before this kind of treatment could
be used to replace insulin injections or pumps.

>>>>>>> Next up, we need to protect the newly transplanted beta cells from
being destroyed by the immune system. One way to do this may be through
immunotherapies, which aim to retrain the immune system so it won’t attack the
>>>>>>> Another potential route is to transplant beta cells in a protective
barrier. This is called beta cell encapsulation. This barrier would allow beta
cells to sense blood glucose levels and let important nutrients they need to
survive in, but would block rogue immune cells from attacking.
>>>>>>> Different methods of beta cell encapsulation have been tested in
animals and shown to successfully protect cells for up to six months. A
handful of encapsulation devices have also been tested in trials with people
with Type 1 diabetes – showing they’re safe in the short-term. Researchers are
now beginning to test if they can protect against immune destruction and help
>>>>>>> This is a really encouraging and fast growing area, but there are
still barriers to overcome. Scientists need to test if protective devices are
safe and beneficial for the longer term. And work out how to make these
>>>>>>> In Type 2 diabetes the body stops responding to insulin, beta cells
stop working properly and they lose their ability to produce insulin over
time. This means you can’t make the right amount of insulin your body needs.
>>>>>>> A hugely promising area of research in Type 2 diabetes is now showing
that remission is possible. Remission means that people have normal blood
>Our scientists are breaking new ground in understanding how to put Type 2
> diabetes into remission. One approach that’s showing exciting promise is
>>>>>>> When it comes to weight loss, people can go into remission through
different ways. But most recently there’s been a real buzz around the results
from our DiRECT trial, which is testing a low-calorie diet alongside weight
loss support from a healthcare professional. At the end of year one, just
under half of people taking part in the trial were in remission.
>>>>>>> A cure can mean different things to different people. While those who
have put their Type 2 diabetes into remission may see it as a cure, it’s
important to remember the condition might come back. Because of this, you’ll
need to carry on having regular health checks. Remission also won’t be
>Excitingly, the evidence building around remission is changing the way we
> think about Type 2 diabetes. Thanks to our research, it’s not necessarily a
>>>>>>> Just like in Type 1 diabetes, our research to engineer beta cells in
the lab could lead to ways of replacing cells that have stopped working in
>>>>>>> Researchers in Canada have recently shown that a combination of stem
cell transplants and diabetes medication successfully treated mice with Type 2
diabetes. And there are early trials going on with people with Type 1
diabetes. If successful these could pave the way to cell replacement therapies
>>>>>>> Scientists are exploring ways to keep beta cells healthy, to stop Type
>>>>>>> Our research fellow, Professor David Hodson, is looking at one way to
do this. He’s using state-of-the-art imaging technology to find out how beta
cells work together in the pancreas. In mice, he found that the pancreas
starts working properly again when a small group of beta cells (called hubs)
are switched on. This opens up possibilities of kick starting these hubs to
help people make the right amount of insulin.
>>>>>>> We’re also supporting Dr Leclerc, who is attempting to work out if a
particular molecule (called sorcin) can protect beta cells from becoming
