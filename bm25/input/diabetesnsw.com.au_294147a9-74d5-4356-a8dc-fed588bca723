Metformin is the first-line drug that can lower blood glucose levels in people
However, one third of patients do not respond to metformin treatment and five
percent experience serious side effects, which is the reason many choose to
New research from Lund University in Sweden has identified biomarkers that can
show in advance how patients will respond to metformin via a simple blood
Charlotte Ling, Lead Author and Professor at Lund University, said “Our study
is an important step towards the goal of personalised care for people
diagnosed with diabetes because it can contribute to ensuring they receive the
right care as soon as they are diagnosed."
When diet and exercise are not enough to regulate blood glucose, metformin is
the first drug introduced to treat type 2 diabetes, according to international
If it does not have the intended effect of lowering blood glucose levels, or
if the patient experiences serious side effects, patients then go on to trial
"If it takes a long time for the patient to receive the correct treatment,
there is a risk of complications due to the elevated blood glucose levels.
Approximately 30 percent of all patients with type 2 diabetes do not respond
to metformin and should be given another drug right from the start. For this
reason, it is important to be able to identify these patients upon diagnosis",
One third of patients usually experience side effects such as nausea, stomach
pain and diarrhoea. Five percent stop taking the medicine due to severe side
The study is the first pharmacoepigenetic study in diabetes, i.e. that
researchers have studied how epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, can
be used as biomarkers to predict the effect of a drug.
"To a certain extent, pharmacoepigenetics has been used within cancer care to
predict how a person will respond to a treatment, however, it has never been
done in diabetes care before", says Prof Ling.
Researchers in the study looked at epigenetic modifications, so-called DNA
methylations, in blood from individuals diagnosed with diabetes before they
In a follow-up a year later, the researchers could see which patients had
benefited from the treatment (with resulting lowered blood glucose levels) and
whether or not they had suffered from side effects.
"By compiling the responses, we have found biomarkers that can identify at
diagnosis which patients will benefit from and tolerate metformin.”
The study was conducted on 363 participants. As a next step, the researchers
are planning for a new clinical study in which they will repeat the study with
a larger patient group - 1000 patients will be invited to participate from all
