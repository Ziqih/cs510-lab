# 10 tips for healthy eating with diabetes
**There are different types of diabetes, and no two people with diabetes are
the same. So there isn’t a one-size-fits-all 'diabetes diet' for everyone with
diabetes. But we’ve come up with tips that you can use to help you make
These healthy eating tips are general and can help you manage your blood
glucose (sugar), blood pressure and cholesterol levels. They can also help you
manage your weight and reduce the risk of diabetes complications, such as
heart problems and strokes, and other health conditions including certain

We've based our tips on research involving people with type 1 and type 2
diabetes. If you have a different type of diabetes, like gestational, cystic
fibrosis-related diabetes or MODY, some of these tips are relevant to you.
It’s important, whatever kind of diabetes you have, to see your dietitian for

## What does eating right mean for you?
If you have type 1 diabetes, carb counting is really important to keep your
blood glucose levels steady. This is where you estimate how many carbs are in
your meal and match it with how much insulin you need to take.
If you have type 2 and you’re overweight, finding a way to lose weight is
important as it really improves diabetes management. This is because it can
help to lower your blood glucose and reduce your risk of other complications.
There are different ways of doing this like the low-carb, Mediterranean or
very low-calorie diets. Losing weight can help you lower your blood glucose
levels, and we now know that substantial weight loss can even put some
Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you might need to lose, gain or
maintain your current weight but it’s important to make healthier food choices
Portion sizes are important to think about whether you have type 1 or type 2.
It makes calculating nutritional facts when you’re carb counting or managing
your weight a lot easier. Remember, portion sizes are different for everyone,
so what’s right for someone else might not be right for you.
If you feel overwhelmed about your feelings about food and diabetes, we have
All carbs affect blood glucose levels so it’s important to know which foods
contain carbohydrates. Choose the healthier foods that contain carbs and be
* whole grains like brown rice, buckwheat and whole oats
* pulses such as chickpeas, beans and lentils
At the same time, it’s also important to cut down on foods low in fibre such
as white bread, white rice and highly-processed cereals. You can check food
labels when you’re looking for foods high in fibre if you’re unsure.
Eating lots of salt can increase your risk of high blood pressure, which in
turn increases risk of heart diseases and stroke. And when you have diabetes,
you’re already more at risk of all of these conditions.
Try to limit yourself to a maximum of 6g (one teaspoonful) of salt a day. Lots
of pre-packaged foods already contain salt so remember to check food labels
and choose those with less salt. Cooking from scratch will help you keep an
eye on how much salt you’re eating. You can also get creative and swap out
salt for different types of herbs and spices to add that extra flavour.
### 3\. Eat less red and processed meat
If you’re cutting down on carbs, you might start to have bigger portions of
meat to fill you up. But it’s not a good idea to do this with red and
processed meat, like ham, bacon, sausages, beef and lamb. These all have links
Try swapping red and processed meat for these:
Beans, peas and lentils are also very high in fibre and don’t affect your
blood glucose levels too much – making them a great swap for processed and red
meat and keeping you feeling full. Most of us know that fish is good for us,
but oily fish like salmon and mackerel are even better. These are rich in
something called omega-3 oil, which helps protect your heart. Try and aim to
eat two portions of oily fish a week.
We know eating fruit and veg is good for you. It’s always a good thing aim to
eat more at meal times and have them as snacks if you’re hungry. This can help
you get the vitamins, minerals and fibre your body needs every day to help
You might be wondering about fruit and if you should avoid it because it’s
sugary? The answer is no. Whole fruit is good for everyone and if you have
diabetes, it’s no different. Fruits do contain sugar, but it’s natural sugar.
This is different to the added sugar (also known as free sugars) that are in
Products like fruit juices also count as added sugar, so go for whole fruit
instead. This can be fresh, frozen, dried or tinned (in juice, not in syrup).
And it’s best to eat it throughout the day instead of one bigger portion in
We all need fat in our diet because it gives us energy. But different types of
Healthier fats are in foods like unsalted nuts, seeds, avocados, oily fish,
olive oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil. Some saturated fats can increase
the amount of cholesterol in your blood, increasing your risk of heart
problems. These are mainly found in animal products and prepared food like:
It’s still a good idea to cut down on using oils in general, so try to grill,
We know cutting out sugar can be really hard at the beginning, so small
practical swaps are a good starting point when you’re trying to cut down on
excess sugar. Swapping sugary drinks, energy drinks and fruit juices with
water, plain milk, or tea and coffee without sugar can be a good start.
You can always try low or zero-calorie sweeteners (also known as artificial
sweeteners) to help you cut back. Cutting out these added sugars can help you
control your blood glucose levels and help keep your weight down. If your
diabetes treatment means you get hypos, and you use sugary drinks to treat
them, this is still important for your diabetes management and you shouldn’t
cut this out. However, if you are having regular hypos it is really important
If you want a snack, choose yoghurts, unsalted nuts, seeds, fruits and
vegetables instead of crisps, chips, biscuits and chocolates. But watch your
portions still – it’ll help you keep an eye on your weight
Alcohol is high in calories, so if you do drink and you’re trying to lose
weight, think about cutting back. Try to keep to a maximum of 14 units a week.
But spread it out to avoid binge drinking, and go several days a week without
If you take insulin or other diabetes medications, it’s also not a good idea
to drink on an empty stomach. This is because alcohol can make hypos more
### 8\. Don’t bother with so-called diabetic food
To say food is a "diabetic food" is now against the law. This is because there
isn’t any evidence that these foods offer you a special benefit over eating
healthily. They can also often contain just as much fat and calories as
similar products, and can still affect your blood glucose level. These foods
### 10\. Get your minerals and vitamins from foods
There’s no evidence that mineral and vitamin supplements help you manage your
diabetes. So, unless you’ve been told to take something by your healthcare
team, like folic acid for pregnancy, you don’t need to take supplements.
It’s better to get your essential nutrients by eating a mixture of different
foods. This is because some supplements can affect your medications or make
Being more physically active goes hand in hand with eating healthier. It can
help you manage your diabetes and also reduce your risk of heart problems.
This is because it increases the amount of glucose used by your muscles and
Try to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity a week.
This is any activity that raises your heart rate, makes you breathe faster and
feel warmer. You should still be able to talk and only be slightly out of
breath. And you don’t have to do all 150 minutes in one go. Break it down into
bite-size chunks of 10 minutes throughout the week or 30 minutes 5 times a
