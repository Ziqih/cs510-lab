“At CSIRO we are about solving the greatest challenges through innovative
science and technology, and critical to improving Australia’s health and
wellbeing is understanding what influences individual health decisions.”
People who lost the highest amount of body fat experienced the greatest
improvements in pre-existing health conditions, with one third of these
respondents reporting improvements in all their diagnosed health conditions.
“Health conditions weren't the only thing that improved – survey respondents
