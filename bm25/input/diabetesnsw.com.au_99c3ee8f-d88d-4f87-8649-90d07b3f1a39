Diabetes Australia has warned that failure to implement a comprehensive
national type 2 diabetes early detection program could be costing the
Australian health system more than $700 million each year.
Diabetes Australia is calling for emergency departments and GP clinics across
Australia to conduct more routine screening in a bid to diagnose up to 500,000
Australians who may currently have silent, undiagnosed type 2 diabetes.
People can have type 2 diabetes for up to seven years before it is diagnosed
and in that time many people will begin to develop debilitating complications
including heart attacks and strokes, eye damage and blindness, foot ulcers and
In many cases, complications can be prevented with early detection and optimal
treatment. New figures were released today at Blacktown Hospital, one of
Australia’s diabetes hotspots, where an innovative diabetes screening program
has found that about half of people being screened in the emergency department
and other settings are found to have either prediabetes or type 2 diabetes –
Today marks the start of National Diabetes Week (8 July – 14 July) and the
launch of a new Diabetes Australia’s 'It’s About Time' campaign.
Diabetes Australia CEO Professor Greg Johnson urged Governments to take action
now to ensure the earlier detection of type 2 diabetes - before people develop
“International evidence has found that early detection and optimal treatment
could save as much as $1,415 per person per year,” Diabetes Australia CEO
“With an estimated 500,000 Australians having silent, undiagnosed type 2
diabetes that could translate to savings of more than $700 million for the
“Early detection and early treatment is likely to provide lasting health
“Systematic early detection of type 2 diabetes is inexpensive and can be
rolled out easily. It’s about time we did so.
“We are calling for the HbA1c test to be incorporated with other blood tests
in emergency departments and other times when doctors are ordering a range of
blood tests. An HbA1c blood test measures long-term blood glucose levels and
is used for the detection and subsequent monitoring of diabetes."
The innovative approach at Blacktown Hospital where Dr Glen Maberly has led
the way in early detection of previously undiagnosed, silent type 2 diabetes
is a great example of what is possible, at low cost.
“We knew the diabetes problem in Western Sydney was serious, but our proactive
detection has revealed it is much worse than we first thought,” Dr Maberly
Dr Maberly’s team initially coordinated the detection of patients presenting
to Emergency Departments (EDs) at Blacktown and Mt Druitt hospitals. Under the
program, patients presenting for other conditions and who needed blood tests,
were also checked for type 2 diabetes using the HbA1c blood test.
Of the 48,000 patients checked in EDs, 30 per cent were likely to have pre-
diabetes, while 17 per cent were likely to have type 2 diabetes.
In the second phase, supported by Western Sydney Primary Health Network (PHN),
11 GPs across western Sydney did diabetes tests on patients who were having
“The results from the GP checks for type 2 diabetes were alarming. Of the
nearly 6,000 people tested, 26 per cent were found to have pre-diabetes, while
17 per cent were likely to have type 2 diabetes,” Professor Maberly said.
Diabetes NSW & ACT CEO Sturt Eastwood said early diagnosis is critical to
reducing the likelihood and impact of diabetes-related complications.
“People can live with type 2 diabetes for up to seven years before being
diagnosed and in that time life-threatening health problems can develop,” Mr
“The earlier people are diagnosed, the earlier they can get the right
treatment, which will reduce their risk of developing diabetes-related
complications including limb amputation, blindness, kidney failure and heart
“It’s about reducing the time people have undiagnosed, silent type 2
