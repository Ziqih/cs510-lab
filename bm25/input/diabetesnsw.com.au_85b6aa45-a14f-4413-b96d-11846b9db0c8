* Type 2 diabetes and me – online course
They say “love the one you’re with”; an expression that I didn’t appreciate
until I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. I’ve not only accepted living with
diabetes, I’ve learned to love it and manage it so that it doesn’t manage me.
Diabetes is a very small part of what makes me Drew. I’m an exercise
physiologist, diabetes educator, sport scientist and most importantly – I’m a
happy and healthy guy thriving with type 1 diabetes.
Sure, my world shifted when I was first diagnosed, but after making positive
changes to the way that I live, eat, move and approach life, I can honestly
say I am happier and healthier today than I was before my diagnosis. So in a
way you could say that diabetes gave me the gift of health.
My aim is to share what I know with others so that we can learn to love our
condition as a partner that walks with us, not one that rules us.
My background as a health professional and my own personal triumph with
managing diabetes has ignited a passion to share everything I know, which is
why I created Drew’s Daily Dose - a home that inspires, empowers and enables
people to thrive with diabetes, rather than simply live with it.
Drew’s Daily Dose is my way of empowering people to take control of their
health, so that like me, they can live a fuller, happier and healthier life
