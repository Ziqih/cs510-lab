Every 20 seconds someone, somewhere on the planet, loses a foot due to
diabetes. Foot ulcers are the starting point of more than 80% of these
The number of people diagnosed with diabetes, globally, has risen from 108m in
1980 to 422m in 2014. This is a huge burden on healthcare services as diabetes
is associated with many long-term health complications, including peripheral
neuropathy, where nerves become damaged, leading to pain, numbness or
People with diabetes who develop neuropathy don’t feel pain when they are
injured, so they may not notice soft tissue damage in the foot (or elsewhere)
until the damage is quite extensive. Many of these people also have peripheral
artery disease (PAD) as a result of poor blood circulation to the legs. PAD
reduces a person’s ability to fight infection and puts them at a higher risk
People with diabetes have a 25% chance of getting foot ulcers. And if a person
develops a foot ulcer they are at an increased risk of amputation because of
infection and other related complications. Diabetes is one of the main causes
People with diabetes have a 25% chance of getting food ulcers.
There are several ways to prevent or treat diabetic foot ulcers: regulating
the person’s blood-sugar levels; ensuring that they are regularly screened for
foot and other diabetes-related problems; educating them about their
condition; and providing special shoes, insoles and foot braces.
The cost of treating diabetes-related foot issues puts a significant financial
burden on healthcare services. In the UK alone the annual cost of treating
“diabetic foot” (as these conditions are called) is about £650m. In the US, it
is reported that the annual direct costs of diabetic foot complications are
While costs are increasing, healthcare professionals have yet to find an
effective way to screen diabetic patients and treat complications caused by
the disease. Our systematic reviews show that more research is needed before
we can be sure about which specialist footwear and footwear materials are the
In most cases, diabetic foot ulcers can be attributed to the accumulation of
some kind of injury, nerve damage and deformity. About 80% of foot ulcers
involve some form of trauma and are therefore potentially preventable. Also,
many foot ulcers develop as a result of ill-fitting shoes.
Previous research examining the causal chain leading to diabetic amputations
in 80 patients found that footwear was a factor in 42% of cases. Evidence
shows that providing appropriate footwear to all patients with diabetes at
risk of ulceration would be a cost-effective and potentially cost saving
Screening in primary care also needs to improve. Our review of foot screening
guidelines and practices from various countries shows that there are
disparities and inconsistencies in the methods and tools used to screen and
diagnose patients at an early stage of their disease. Many of the screening
guidelines are classified as “strong recommendation, based on low evidence”.
When there is a strong recommendation for a specific treatment, there should
Often, when high quality evidence is not available, doctors have to make an
educated guess based on their clinical experience. But there are lots of
technological developments, such as gait analysis, thermal imaging and new
materials for footwear, and healthcare professionals should start using these
lightbox-basic)Current guidelines also fail to take the needs of different
cultural and ethnic groups into account. For example, in certain cultures
people don’t wear shoes in the house or places of worship, and this puts them
at a higher risk of developing ulcers. Our review shows that there is a clear
need for culturally specific, up-to-date guidelines on screening for and
treating diabetic foot. Without them, we will continue to see unnecessary
