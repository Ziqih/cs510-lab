# Diabetes UK funds £4.7 million BAME research
Diabetes UK has so far invested £4.7 million funding specialist research into
how the condition affects Asian, Black and minority ethnic peoples according
Research is vital as the condition develops and progresses in different ways
for people of different ethnicities. For example, people from South Asian
communities are two to four times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than
The funding has so far supported 41 projects across the UK, with over £3.6
Diabetes UK Director of Research, Dr Elizabeth Robertson, said: “Some of us
are at increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, so our research aims to
find out why that is and what we can do about it. We’re building on the
results of remarkable research that has already been supported by Diabetes
Current research includes a project at King’s College London, looking at how
the biology underlying the development of Type 2 diabetes can differ in people
from different ethnic groups. In the future, this information could help to
tailor therapies that can prevent or treat Type 2 diabetes to those who will
Dr Louise Goff, the lead investigator on the project at Kings College London,
said: “Type 2 diabetes is less closely linked to levels of fat around the
waist and high blood cholesterol for Black African people than for White
European people. Finding out more about what causes Type 2 diabetes is
essential, so we can use the right strategies to prevent the condition from
In 2012, Diabetes UK funded researchers at the University of Leicester to
develop a Type 2 diabetes screening questionnaire that could be used in non-
English speaking communities that were at a high risk of developing the
Naina Patel, the lead researcher on the project, said: “We know that there can
be higher rates of undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related
complications among South Asian people. It’s therefore important that the
tools used to screen people for Type 2 diabetes are easy to use and
understand, to make them more effective at identifying those at risk.”
Diabetes UK also provided the initial support for the Southall and Brent
Revisited (SABRE) study, which monitored the health of 4,200 Londoners and
discovered that half of all British South Asians, Africans and African
Caribbean’s will have Type 2 diabetes by the age of eighty, compared to one in
five people of European descent. The SABRE study is ongoing, and has helped
push the need for Black and South Asian people to be screened for Type 2
Recently Diabetes UK asked people with Type 2 diabetes and healthcare
professionals to submit their questions and concerns about Type 2 diabetes
research, which will guide the charity’s top ten priorities for funding in the
future. Nearly 1 in 4 of the responses are from people of BAME (Black, Asian
and minority ethnic background, to ensure future research work reflects the
Diabetes UK Engaging Communities Manager, Krishna Sarda, said: “While research
helps to find solutions for the future, there are steps all of us can take now
to reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, or to manage the condition
more effectively if you already have it. Our Community Champions go out to
engage with people who have the highest risk of developing Type 2 diabetes,
explaining what it is, who is at risk, signs and symptoms, myths and
