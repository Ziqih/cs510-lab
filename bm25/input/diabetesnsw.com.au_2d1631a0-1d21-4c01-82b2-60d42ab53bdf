700g chicken breast or thigh fillets, trimmed, cut into strips
2 tablespoons Keens curry powder (a basic non-spicy powder)
4 tablespoons currants / small sweet rindless raisins
2 cups cooked Doongara rice (low GI rice)
1. Heat oil in frypan over low heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent.
2. Turn heat up to medium and add chicken and garlic. Cook for several minutes until the chicken has turned slightly golden.
3. Add curry powder and stir well. Cook until fragrant - the point when the spices start wafting from the pan.
4. Turn heat down to low and add evaporated milk, coconut essence and currants.
5. Simmer for around 5 minutes and throw in the green beans. Continue to simmer for another few minutes then turn off heat.
6. Serve rice topped with curry, a handful of coriander and a side of cucumber.
Curries are often high in fat due to the use of coconut milk. By replacing
this with evaporated skim milk and a small amount of coconut essence you can
help turn your indulgent curry recipe into a healthy family favourite!
