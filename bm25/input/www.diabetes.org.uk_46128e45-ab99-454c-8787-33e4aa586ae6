and clinical psychologist, Dr Jen Nash, who also has Type 1 diabetes, on the
They’ve suggested eating swaps you can make and psychological techniques you
can use to make you more aware and think about what you’re about to do…
## Habit 1: Eating in the evening due to boredom
Try to keep busy rather than slumping in front of the TV, but if nothing works
and you know you’re a snacker, save some calories for the end of the day.
Prepare some vegetable crudités and make dips such as healthier hummus,
tzatziki or salsa. Have a low-calorie hot chocolate to curb a sweet craving.
Think creatively about ways to spend the evening, so you are doing things
other than just watching TV until bed. Evenings can be unstructured time for
many people – so introducing a bit of structure can be oddly relaxing. Having
a TV hour, a housework hour, a kids, partner or chat on the phone hour, for
example, means there’s less time to be restless and hopefully you won’t find
## Habit 2: Skipping breakfast, not having regular meals and grazing rather
If you’re not trying to lose weight or if missing meals is not impacting on
your diabetes management or health, this might not be a big issue if that’s
If you find yourself hungry and making unhealthy choices then it is. If time's
short in the morning, grab a piece of fruit or take individual porridge
Switch unhealthy snacks for packets of nuts, an apple, crackers or reduced-fat
cheese with a few cherry tomatoes. Buy a plastic snack box and fill it with
healthy snacks. Try tinned food with a ring pull that you can carry with you
and make up a lunch on the go eg pineapple or tuna.
Redefine how you think about mealtimes – do you give food the respect it
deserves? In days gone by when food was scarce, mealtimes were important
‘formalities’ but our modern-day lives make the whole eating experience less
of a priority. Think about how you could experience food fully, even if it’s
on the go. Sitting down to eat or not combining eating with other activities,
can be ‘formalities’ to help give food and mealtimes the respect they deserve.
## Habit 3: Ordering a takeaway because it’s easier than cooking
Try batch cooking so you’ve always got something in the freezer. Cook double
the amount, separate portions into microwaveable boxes and freeze.
Have a handful of fail-safe recipes stuck in a book, that you can turn to when
you need a quick meal and keep your store cupboard stocked with the
Often we link a takeaway with a treat and throw all our healthy eating
principles out of the window when it arrives at the door, we then end up
eating far more than we normally would. If life's busy and takeaways are
inevitable, you can still decide to eat a similar-sized portion to a home-
cooked meal, instead of the over-sized portion someone else has decided for
Try squirting washing-up liquid over the plate as soon as you've cleared it so
you're not tempted to hoover up the leftovers. Don’t think of what the kids
have left as wasted food – you’re not a human dustbin! If you eat it when you
don’t really need it or want it – it's just a habit that you'll regret
afterwards. You could have some veggie crudites or chopped fruit ready in the
fridge, so you're not tempted to graze and you have have something healthier
Do you ever say to yourself: ‘It’s wrong to waste food?’ Eating leftovers can
be as much about not wasting food as it is about how tasty the scraps are.
Many of us had this rule drummed into us as kids, but in our modern worlds of
plentiful foods, the best thing you can do is to start to answer back when
your brain pipes up. Great answers include: ‘Do I really need this?’ or ‘I’m
not a bin for leftover food.’ Try them out.
## Habit 5: Snacking on cakes and biscuits in the office or work
At work, swap the biscuit barrel for a bowl of fruit. Speak to your colleagues
– you never know they might want to join you in eating more healthily and will
probably be relieved that the temptation is being removed. Could you all bring
different varieties of fruit, so you never get bored? Sometimes the odd treat
helps you keep to newly formed healthier eating goals, so instead of banning
sugary treats completely save the biscuits for just one day a week. Biscuit
Work-time snacks can be a bit of much needed ‘down-time’ or stress relief as
they are about the taste. We bond with co-workers and strengthen team
relationships through shared eating experiences. Chat to your colleagues – can
you replace one of your usual snack times with walk to the park together, a
walk-and-chat to the post room or sharing your favourite app? Be creative
about other ways to get a break in your day.
Try to buy ready-sliced bread and freeze it and only get out what you need.
Buy bread rolls so you know the portion sizes, this can help you stay on track
– especially important if you are counting your carbs.
Bread has been a staple part of many of our diets for so long that it can feel
like you’re missing out when you cut back. Take baby steps towards your goal,
cut down by half a slice a week. Replace bread with something else while
reducing the amounts, for example oatcakes, crispbreads, crackers or bread
sticks are all different types of carbs to experiment with as swaps.
Try to replace sweets with fruit – fresh, frozen, dried or tinned. Chop fruit
into plastic lidded containers and pop into the fridge so you’ve got a go-to
snack when you’re tempted to have sweets. Small tins of fruit such as
pineapple, in juice not syrup, with a ring pull are an easy go-to snack when
you fancy something sweet. Sugar-free jelly, low-calorie chocolate drinks,
natural yogurt with added chopped fruit are all good too. Why not pop grapes
in the freezer to suck on or dried unsweetened dates – they come out chewy,
Try mindful eating. ‘Domino’ foods like sweets can hypnotise us – hand to
packet, to mouth, to packet, to mouth… and on it goes.
Play some games with yourself – double (or triple!) the amount of time each
sweet is in your mouth, count to 10 (or 20) between each one, figure out if
there’s another type of ‘sweetness’ you’re really craving (a hug, a laugh,
You may already know that butter contains saturated fat, which is not good for
your heart health. A better option would be an unsaturated fat, such as
sunflower spread or olive oil spread, but you still have to watch your portion
sizes especially if you are trying to lose weight. Save the butter for the
occasional treat, for example a meal out. If you don't like spread, a
compromise would be a lower-fat butter. Try making sandwiches moist using
tomatoes or grated cucumber instead of butter or spread.
Humans are creatures of habit! If you want to break a habit you’ve held for
years, you need to remind yourself of the new one so you don’t return to your
‘default’. Put a sticker or post-it note on your spread tub – writing yourself
a message or sticking an inspirational photo there is optional.
## Habit 9: Feeling pressurised to eat the same as everyone else when you’re
At a restaurant, be the first to pick off the menu, so you’re less likely to
be swayed by other people’s choices. Go online before you leave and check out
the menu, so you know what the healthier options are before you go.
Choose your meal before you drink any alcohol as this may challenge your will
power and don’t arrive at the restaurant hungry or you might order too much
Try to have a lower-calorie snack, such a piece of fruit, a few raw veggies or
a cup of soup, before you go. If you’re out and about, pop a healthy snack in
your bag, so you’re not tempted to grab a chocolate bar when hunger strikes.
It’s hard being the ‘good’ one! Rehearse saying no in the mirror in advance –
hearing yourself speak the words helps you prepare. Saying what you are going
to eat rather than what you are not can help.Try the 3 C’s – speak with
Confidence, Clarity and (Eye) Contact. Being upbeat and smiling tends to
silence any possible ‘Go on, you deserve it’ type comments.
