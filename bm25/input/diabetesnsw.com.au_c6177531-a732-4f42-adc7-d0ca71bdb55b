Sexual dysfunction can arise as a complication from living with diabetes. It
is important to address any issues with your health care team as sexual
dysfunction can create difficulties with intimacy in the bedroom, affecting
relationships outside the bedroom and your quality of life.
Sexual dysfunction is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an
adequate sexual response to a sexual encounter or intercourse resulting in a
satisfactory orgasm or pleasure. Sexual dysfunction affects both males and
* Diminished libido (not wanting to have sex)
* Emotional issues leading to problems such as achieving orgasm, erectile dysfunction in men, and pain and lubrication in women
Erectile dysfunction (also called impotence) is a persistent inability to
achieve or maintain an adequate erection in order to have a satisfactory
sexual encounter. For men with diabetes reduced blood flow and nerve damage
can be the underlying issue of erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction may
or may not affect ejaculation. Mental health, body image and high blood
glucose levels can affect libido reducing the desire to engage in sex.
Erectile dysfunction is often considered a condition of older males. However,
20% of men with diabetes experience significant ED from their late forties. Up
to 58% of young men with type 1 diabetes may also experience ED.
Other factors that may contribute to or cause erectile dysfunction in men
* High blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, unhealthy weight, heart disease
* Medications including blood pressure meds such as beta blockers, various groups of antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics and cancer medications
* Spinal cord injury, pelvic surgery, multiple sclerosis
Making lifestyle modifications may help improve sexual dysfunction:
It is important to recognise that men who exercise regularly have a 70% risk
reduction in erectile dysfunction compared to men that don’t exercise.
Medications called phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors are the most commonly
available treatment for erectile dysfunction and include the drugs sildenafil
and tadalafil. These medications are prescription only and need to be taken
about one hour before the desired effect. They do have some side effects and
Other treatments include vacuum pumps, injections or inflatable prosthesis.
Sexual dysfunction (SD) is not as well reported in women, as the diagnosis is
harder to identify than in men and there are multiple factors that affect
Women living with diabetes experiencing sexual dysfunction may experience
vaginal dryness, a decrease in sexual desire, pain during sex and trouble
having an orgasm. Women may experience higher rates of issues with sexual
Up to 33% of women living with type 1 diabetes have reported experiencing some
form of SD. This study included younger women with the average age of
participants being 42 years old. Up to 68% of women living with type 2
diabetes also experience issues. Common symptoms that women in both groups
Treatment options for women living with diabetes include:
* Lubricants to help with vaginal dryness and reduce pain when sexually intimate
* Antidepressants to help with depression and improve mental health
A drug approved in the US, the first ever drug to treat low sexual desire in
women, has been approved for use in premenopausal women with low sexual
desire. The drug is called Fliberanserin. It is not yet approved in Australia.
People living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes can experience body image and
mental health issues that can impact on self-esteem and relationships.
* In people with type 1 diabetes, issues may present such as feeling embarrassed for partners to see insulin pumps and CGMs, bruising and scarring from injection sites, or it may be the issue of trying to negotiate pump sites when being intimate.
* In people living with type 2 diabetes, they may feel weight stigma surrounding type 2 diabetes, as they are told it is a lifestyle condition. Issues with self-image regarding bruising and scarring can also occur if people are injecting insulin as part of their treatment.
Diabetes distress and the ongoing issues when dealing with daily diabetes
decisions impacts significantly on people’s mental health, causing depression
and anxiety. Medication prescribed for depression can affect sexual
dysfunction as a side effect. Antidepressants known as selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported to cause sexual dysfunction in
Issues that both men and women face each day dealing with diabetes, can impact
on confidence. These issues need to be discussed in any healthy relationship.
Talking to a psychologist about any concerns is a good place to start.
Often people do not raise concerns regarding sexual dysfunction because they
either are embarrassed to raise the issue, consider it a normal part of
getting old, do not know what they experience can be a complication of
diabetes and are not aware of treatment options. Other barriers also include
Health professionals may have difficulties addressing sexual dysfunction due
to time constraints, lack of knowledge, training or resources. If you
experience problems having topics addressed by your health team you should
request a referral to a health professional that is able to help.
Identifying areas that you may need help in is key; understand what you want
to discuss with your health care team and make a list:
* Talk to your partner about your concerns and take them to appointments so you have support to address them with your health team
* Talk to your doctor about your issues
* Take a note with what you want to talk about and list your symptoms
* If you cannot get satisfactory help from your healthcare team ask for a referral
Lastly, if you experience depression, anxiety, body image or mental health
