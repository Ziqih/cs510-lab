Ever wondered which is better: butter or margarine? Dark chocolate or milk
chocolate? Full-cream or low-fat dairy? We’ve sized up the saturated fat
Swapping foods high in saturated fat for healthier options is a simple way to
reduce your heart disease risk and improve your diabetes management.
You may know that saturated fat in food is the type that raises LDL-
cholesterol levels in your blood. This ‘bad’ cholesterol deposits in your
arteries, and over time, can lead to a blockage and raise your risk of heart
This is why 24 grams (or less!) is the amount of saturated fat recommended to
Aussie adults each day for a healthy heart.
What many people don’t realise, is that saturated fat in your diet makes it

saturated fat intake creep up, but low-fat has been getting a bad rap in the
media for having extra hidden sugars or salt. It is true some low-fat yoghurt,
custard, ice cream and cheese contain added sugars or salt to improve their
flavour, but what the media don’t point out, is plain milk and natural yoghurt
 **Verdict:** For ice cream, custard and yoghurt, compare brands to find low-
fat dairy products with the least added sugar.
Reduced-fat milks and plain yoghurts are a great way to skim your saturated
fat intake and kilojoules, without compromising on nutrition. One glass of soy
