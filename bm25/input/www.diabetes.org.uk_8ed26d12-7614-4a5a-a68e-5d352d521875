## Diabetes is the most common cause of lower limb amputations in the UK
We can reveal that there were 27,465 lower limb amputations related to
diabetes in England from 2015 to 2018, marking a significant increase of 18.3%
from 2011 to 2014. Major amputations, defined as below the knee, were up by
8.8%, whilst minor amputations, defined as below the ankle, were up by 22.4%.
Someone living with diabetes is 20 times more likely to experience an
amputation than someone without the condition. This is because high blood
sugar levels can damage blood vessels, affecting how blood flows to the feet
Unhealed ulcers and foot infections are the leading cause of diabetes related
amputations, with diabetic foot ulcers preceding more than 80% of amputations.
Both foot ulcers and amputations are also hugely costly for the NHS, with at
least £1 in every £140 of NHS spending going towards foot care for people with
This rise in diabetes related amputations are partly due to the fact that 1 in
6 hospitals still do not have multidisciplinary specialist foot care teams
(MDFT). These teams, which often include podiatrists, physicians and nurses,
are integral to delivering a high quality of care and their absence may result
in inconsistent access to treatment and outcomes across the nation.
For people with diabetes, problems with the feet arising from foot ulcers and
infections can develop and deteriorate very quickly. That’s why people with
diabetes need rapid access to an MDFT when they have a foot problem.

Evidence shows the longer the delay before being seen by an MDFT, the more
likely it will be that foot ulcers become severe and slow to heal, increasing
Foot problems can be devastating to a person’s quality of life and are often
life-threatening. That’s why we’re urging NHS England to deliver on its
commitment made in the NHS Long-Term Plan to invest further in developing
diabetes foot care, so that all hospitals provide access to a MDFT.

A matter of hours can make the difference between losing and keeping a foot.
This is why it’s vital for all people living with diabetes to know how to look
after their feet, to check them regularly to look out for the signs of foot
problems and to know when to seek medical attention.
