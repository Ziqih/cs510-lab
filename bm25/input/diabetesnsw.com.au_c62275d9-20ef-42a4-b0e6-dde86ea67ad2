We all get wounds occassionally, but living with diabetes means you also live
with a higher risk of infection. Below is advice on how to care for a wound;
however if you are in any doubt ask your pharmacist or GP.
## You should go straight to your doctor when:
* You can’t remember when you last had a tetanus injection
* Wounds fail to heal or if ulceration occurs
* You have callouses on your feet or severely cracked heels (see a podiatrist)
* Wounds break open or are more than skin deep
* A wound is weeping or develops an odour
* Other things happen such as bleeding from your mouth, nose, eyes, ears or genital area
* You also have a bad headache or loss of consciousness, slurred speech or blurred vision
* The redness around the wound increases in size or becomes more painful, or you develop a fever
* Burns that are larger than a 20-cent coin or deeper than your first layer of skin, or on your face or genital area.
Airing a wound or applying powder will slow healing. Applying a dressing
provides protection from further damage and bacteria. Dressings should keep a
wound warm and moist but still allow the wound to breathe.
 **Antiseptics and wound cleansing** will reduce the risk of infection. A
gentle wash with saline or tap water can be used to remove dirt, sand or
gravel from a wound such as a graze, skin tear or shallow cut. Usually you
don’t need an antiseptic as they slow healing or restart bleeding. You could
reserve them for situations where your skin is broken in the presence of a
highly infective agents such as: another’s bodily fluids, faeces or rotting
matter. Always use the antiseptic as directed. Dilute a strong solution of
antiseptic to avoid burning your skin. If you use a disinfectant wash leave it
on for three to four minutes and rinse it off with tap water or saline. Self-
cleaning of wounds is for the first time only. If you feel a wound requires
recleaning, go to your GP. If you need to dry a wound after cleaning, use a
product that is clean and will not stick or leave lint. Cotton wool can be
used during gentle wet cleaning of the area but not for drying.
 **Creams, ointments or gels** are generally not necessary for healing. The
exceptions are burns and skin tears which benefit from hydrogels such as
_Solosite, Solugel_ or wound aid gels. Always run a burn under cool water (no
ice or ice water) for 20 minutes before doing anything else. For a small burn
apply a liberal amount of gel before applying a dressing. Do not burst
blisters. Blisters protect underlying skin and reduce infection.
If your wound is clean and not infected leave it alone. If you feel the need
to add an ointment before applying a dressing you could use povidone iodine
such as _Betadine_ , medical grade manuka honey or use a silver dressing to
reduce the risk of infection. There is no need to reapply ointments with
 **Plastic/fabric strips** are fine for a shallow cut especially on your
fingers, as long you clean and dry the cut first. If cuts are deep or getting
 **Film island dressings** are for shallow cuts or grazes. The island part of
the dressing is a non-stick dressing that is surrounded and covered by an
adhesive film. The adhesive film may be waterproof. This allows you to bathe
without wetting the wound. Examples are _Cutifilm Plus_ or _Opsite Post Op_.
The film may be a stretchy fabric type which will conform and stretch with
body parts such as knees and elbows. Examples are _Primapore_ or _Cutiplast_.
These dressings will absorb a small amount of weeping. If your wound is
weeping larger amounts of fluid see your GP. The non-stick part of the
dressing must be bigger than the wound. Dressings can be left on for seven
days undisturbed. Each time you redress a wound, healing is disturbed.
 **If you have fragile skin** the adhesives in island dressings may cause your
skin damage upon removal. Instead try a non-stick dressing such as _Melonin_
or _Cutifilm_. Always place the plastic side down on the wound. These
dressings are kept in place by a light crepe bandage or a self-adhering wrap
such as _Easyfix Cohesive_ or a _Tubifast_. Wraps and bandages must never be
tight enough to restrict blood flow. _Allevyn_ gentle border is also suitable
 **For skin tears** replace the flap with sterile tweezers and control the
bleeding with gentle pressure from a sterile dressing, rinse with tap water or
saline, dab dry with a lint free dressing, attach a wound closure strip across
the tear, apply a small amount of hydrogel and then apply an island dressing
as above and leave this on undisturbed for seven days.
 **Silicone coated dressings** are gentle and minimize pain without sticking
to the wound. They are suitable for fragile skin. Example are _Allevyn_ and
_Mepilex_. They are designed to kept on the wound for a week and may be cost
If you are not sure about a wound, seek medical attention. Procrastination
with wounds and burns leads to ulcers that are much harder to heal.
