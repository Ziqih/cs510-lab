# Genes involved in diabetic kidney disease identified
Kidney disease is a serious complication that develops in some people living
with diabetes – both Type 1 and Type 2. That’s because diabetes affects the
kidneys' ability to filter extra water and waste products from the body and
leads to high blood pressure, swollen extremities, loss of concentration,
"Studies have shown that diabetic kidney disease tends to run in families in
some populations, suggesting a genetic predisposition," explained Karl
Tryggvason, Professor in Diabetes Research at Duke-NUS' Medical School.
However, identifying the specific genes involved has remained a challenge.
Scientists also still don't know precisely how diabetic kidney disease
Prof Tryggvason led a team that focused on analyzing genes in Finns. "This
population is uniquely homogeneous and has the world's highest incidence of
Type 1 diabetes. They have accumulated rare genetic traits that can help in
The team compared the genomes of 76 Finnish sibling pairs, where both siblings
had Type 1 diabetes for more than 15 years but only one had developed diabetic
kidney disease. They looked for differences between the siblings at the
They then validated their results by analyzing the genes of more than 3,500
unrelated Finns with Type 1 diabetes, almost 40 per cent of whom had diabetic
Their analysis found several genes that could be involved in the development
of the disease by coding for mutations in protein-modifying enzymes belonging
to a large family of proteins called protein kinase C. These proteins are
essential for the function of cells involved in filtering blood inside the
kidneys, and could be attractive targets for treating diabetic kidney disease.
Prof Tryggvason's diabetes research among Finns has advanced the understanding
of diabetic kidney disease worldwide. The findings have major implications for
the development of better prevention and treatment strategies."
Further investigations are needed in other populations and in pre-clinical
models of the disease to confirm the roles of these genes and proteins in the
condition. Duke-NUS researchers are now sequencing the genomes of 1,000
Singaporeans with diabetes to compare with the findings from the Finnish
study. This collaboration with researchers from Singapore aims to further
improve the understanding of diabetic kidney disease and working to reduce its
