If you’re going to someone’s house for food, ask your host about what food
they’ll serve in advance and at what time they’re aiming to eat, so you know
whether to have a snack or light meal before you go.
Don’t feel awkward about asking – people like to be aware of special dietary
Alternatively, if you’re cooking for people with diabetes, you might not be
sure whether you need to make something different for them. Good news: in most
cases you don’t. But check with your guest to find out if they have any
specific dietary requirements – talking to them in advance will mean neither
of you need to worry about it on the day.
Sometimes, guests with diabetes might want to know what’s in the dishes you’re
making and how you’ve put them together. This might be so they can work out
the carb content of your food – this information will help them to manage
their diabetes including working out how much insulin they need to take. Some
may also have additional dietary needs, such as gluten free, nut free etc.
When it comes to dessert, fruit often gets overlooked. Over Christmas, when
you might be eating out more than usual, some fresh fruit salad will taste
great and refreshing. It’s also fine to decline a dessert every so often too.
If chocolates, mince pies or petits fours are served with coffee after a meal,
don’t feel that you have to eat them. It’s also fine to share a small portion
of dessert with someone else who does not want a whole portion.
If you're at home, try our Christmas pudding recipe for a healthier version.
