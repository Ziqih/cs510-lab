# Keeping your eyes open on optical health
On average, one in three people living with diabetes will develop some form of
diabetic vision loss over their lifetime. It’s important to look after your
eyes, and there are a number of things you can do to reduce your risks.
Get your eyes checked when you’re diagnosed and then at least every two years
after by an optometrist or an opthalmologist. This way any early signs of
damage can be picked up and treated immediately, which can delay or even
##**2\. Manage your blood glucose levels over time**
Everyone has periods where their blood glucose levels are out of whack, but if
you’re struggling to keep your levels in target range long-term it’s important
to speak to your diabetes healthcare team about management strategies. High
blood glucose levels can cause a short-term blurring of vision or lead to
longer-term problems like diabetic retinopathy which occurs when high blood
glucose levels damage the small blood vessels in the retina of the eye.
##**3\. Have healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels**
Many eye diseases, particularly those associated with diabetes, are linked to
other health conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
Having healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels can help reduce your risk
While we don’t immediately link regular exercise and a healthy diet to our eye
health, they can help manage blood glucose levels, blood pressure and
cholesterol. Aim to exercise for half an hour every day and follow a well-
rounded diet. You can find more information on what constitutes as a healthy
diet or by speaking to your Accredited Practising Dietitian.
If you experience any of the following symptoms, or any changes in your
vision, contact your doctor or optometrist. Symptoms include:
* Blurred, distorted or patchy vision that can’t be fixed with prescription glasses.
* Problems with balance, reading, watching TV and recognising people.
