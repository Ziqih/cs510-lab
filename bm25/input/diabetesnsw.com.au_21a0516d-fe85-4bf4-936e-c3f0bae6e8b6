1 cup diced dried fruit (peaches, apples, apricots)
1. Mix the flour and almond meal in a mixing bowl, make a well in the centre. Whisk together the milk and eggs in a jug and pour into the flour mixture. Mix to combine being careful not to over mix. Fold in the dried fruit.
2. Heat a large non stick frypan over a moderate heat. Spray the pan with olive oil spray away from the heat and cook heaped tablespoons of the mixture for 1 minute or until golden brown. Turn the pikelets and cook for another minute on the second side. Transfer the pikelets to a plate and continue cooking the remaining mixture.
3. Serve the pikelets with a little cream cheese and a drizzle of honey. (Note - 1 pikelet per serve)
