# Could type 1 diabetes be two separate conditions?
New research has found that type 1 diabetes could be two separate conditions.
The study, conducted at the University of Exeter, and published by
Diabetologia - has shown that children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes under
the age of seven have a different form (or "endotype"), compared to children
For the first time, the researchers found that children diagnosed under 7
years old do not process insulin properly and the cells that make it are
quickly destroyed. Surprisingly, those 13 or over often continue to produce
The findings reignite important questions about whether these "dormant"
insulin-producing cells could be reinvigorated to work more effectively.
In their paper, the Exeter team has suggested new names for the two distinct
endotypes: Type 1 Diabetes Endotype 1 (T1DE1) for the diagnosis in the
youngest children, and Type 1 Diabetes Endotype 2 (T1DE2) for those who are
Professor Noel Morgan, of the University of Exeter Medical School, said,
“We're extremely excited to find evidence that type 1 diabetes is two separate
“The significance of this could be enormous in helping us to understand what
causes the condition, and in unlocking avenues to prevent future generations
“It might also lead to new treatments, if we can find ways to reactivate
dormant insulin-producing cells in the older age group. This would be a
significant step towards the holy grail to find a cure for some people."
The paper proposes that children diagnosed between the ages of 7 and 12 could
fall into either the T1DE 1 or T1DE2 group. The research team is now working
on more precise ways to define which type of diabetes such children have by
studying the small amounts of insulin released into their blood.
The Exeter team reached their conclusions by analysing two bioresources
including the unique Exeter pancreatic biobank comprising more than 130
samples, many of which come from children and young people who died soon after
being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. This is the most extensive resource of
its type anywhere in the world. They also studied whether the differences seen
in the pancreas are mirrored in the blood of people diagnosed with type 1
Sarah Richardson, Associate Professor at the University of Exeter Medical
School, said, “Our research could have a significant impact on current
“We're seeing a lot of promise in immunotherapies which can slow progression,
but so far that hasn't translated into effective new treatments. It could be
that we need to focus on the use of different therapies in each age group, for
Dr. Elizabeth Robertson, Director of Research at Diabetes UK, said, “The era
of being able to halt the immune attack behind type 1 diabetes is in reach,
but to make new treatments as effective as possible we need to really get to
“Today's news brings us one step closer to achieving that.”
Being able to make the distinction between different subtypes of type 1
diabetes is an exciting new development and we're proud to have supported this
We now need to make sure this discovery is used to help design trials and
tailor future treatments, so we can move closer to stopping and preventing
