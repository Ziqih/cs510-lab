When looking after somebody else is your full-time job, it’s easy to forget to
look after yourself. But when you look after your own health, and manage your
diabetes well, you’ll be better able to care for those who need you. In this
article we’ll go through some simple tips for making quick and easy meals to
help keep you, and those you care for, healthy and energised.
Making healthy meals at home doesn’t have to be complicated! Aim to eat some
fresh fruit and vegetables, low fat, unsweetened dairy products, wholegrains
and some lean protein sources such as meat, fish, legumes or nuts and seeds,
every day. Try to stock up on long-life staples from these core food groups so
you’ll always have something healthy on hand. When choosing packaged products,
read the label and go for options that are lower in added sugars and salt, and
When you’re in need of a quick meal try following the '3 **B** s'. Pantry
staples such as wholegrain **b** read, **b** ananas and **b** eans are a great
source of low glycaemic index carbohydrates and can form the basis for simple
healthy meals and snacks. Here are some examples:
* Banana, low-fat plain yoghurt & untoasted muesli
* Wholegrain bread or wrap with a small can of tuna and salad
* Canned beans with a tin of tuna, salad and a drizzle of olive oil
When it comes to healthy eating, the meals you make at home are usually best.
However as a full-time carer, you might not always have the time or energy to
cook from scratch. Cooking in bulk and freezing some meals for later, or
having one or two store-bought convenience meals in the freezer for
emergencies can save you from reaching for the phone and ordering takeaway.
Look for frozen meals that are based on vegetables and wholegrains and lower
in saturated fat, sodium and kilojoules, then add extra vegetables or salad to
boost the fibre and nutrient content. You can find a list of healthy
convenience meal options in the Healthy Shopping Guide, or come along to one
of our Shop SMART programs where you’ll learn to read food labels and choose
