There is no denying COVID-19 has been challenging for many Australians, and
those across the world. Regardless of geographic location we have all felt the
impact of the current situation in one way or another. You may have been
impacted by unemployment, an inability to connect with close friends and
While it has been challenging, there are also some positives we can take from
the past months. For many it was an opportunity to stop and realise the
importance of their health, good personal hygiene, enjoying outdoor
activities, and having more time to create healthy recipes to share with the
Many of us have learnt to adapt with the current situation utilising makeshift
equipment in the home to simulate a gym based setting, or following group
based exercise sessions via online video conferencing platforms such as zoom.
Bottles filled with water or sand, resistance bands, skipping ropes, exercise
balls, towels or exercise mats were all great options that became staples for
Now that most gyms are re-opening across Australia, many of you may be looking
forward to resuming your previous regime. However, there are some important
things you should consider before jumping straight back into it!
Individuals living with diabetes aren’t necessarily at increased risk of
contracting COVID-19, however you are at greater risk of complications if the
virus is contracted. The good thing is we can all take steps to manage our own
personal hygiene and ensure the health of those around us by maintaining
social distancing principles. These include maintaining a 1.5-2m distance
between others and washing your hands regularly with warm water and soap for
20-30 seconds. Avoid touching your face while outside the house and, if using
exercise equipment in a public space, remember to use a towel and wipe
equipment down with sanitising spray or wet wipes after each use.
## **Winter months & dealing with respiratory issues**
As we enter winter, exercising with respiratory conditions like asthma can
present some obstacles for sufferers. When engaging in physical activity your
ventilation rate and heart rate increase with added demand for oxygen by
working muscles. For people living with asthma or Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD) respiratory function and involvement in structured
exercise can be impacted particularly during the colder months.
Exercise and cold air are both triggers for individuals with Asthma or COPD,
therefore it is important to consider the following:
* Start exercise with a graded warm up that increases body temperature, progressively elevates your heart rate and breathing rate
* It is a great idea to conclude your session with a gentle cool down
* Avoid exposure to pollen and pollution where possible
* Ensure you have an action plan in place for your asthma
* Just as you would with your hypo treatment, if you suffer from asthma it’s important to ensure you always have your Ventolin inhaler on hand
* Talk-Sing-Test – Aim for a moderate intensity, whereby you can hold a conversation during exercise but can’t sing!
As the old saying goes 'Rome wasn’t built in a day', so neither should your
physical fitness. Resistance bands or makeshift hand weights using drink
bottles are fantastic options for a home setting, however may not provide the
same stimulus that other gym based equipment does. It is important to ease
back into structured exercise. Start with one or two resistance training
sessions each week and work up to three or more days as your strength and
Flu vaccination is important for individuals living with diabetes as they are
at increased risk of developing serious flu complications. Having a flu
vaccination each year before winter arrives is the best way to prevent the
flu. Additional measures to ensure respiratory hygiene can help to prevent the
spread of flu particularly in a gym setting where droplet transmission is of
increased likelihood. It is important to remember to stay home and seek
medical advice if you feel unwell. Call the National Coronavirus Helpline on
