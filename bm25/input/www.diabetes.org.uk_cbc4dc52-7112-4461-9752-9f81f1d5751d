Most areas of care in diabetes are relevant to all age groups but there are
some specific changes due to growing older which might affect your diabetes.
In some cases dietary advice for the older person with diabetes may differ
from general recommendations. Older people in care homes are often more likely
to be underweight than overweight and there is a high rate of undernutrition.
It may not always be appropriate to reduce the fat, salt and sugar for every
older person with diabetes. Poor or irregular eating can often be a cause of
Poor oral health, effects of some drugs on the digestive system, limited
mobility, dexterity or vision can all cause discomfort associated with eating.
Fluid intake is often lower in older people which can cause dehydration,
particularly during bouts of illness. People at risk should have a nutritional
assessment and individual advice from a dietitian to address areas of concern
such as needing extra calories, meal supplements and replacements, weight
Nutritional assessment and diet should form part of your individual care plan
if you live in a care home. Personal food preferences are important in any
diet plan and older people with diabetes should be able to continue to enjoy a
wide variety of foods. Staff, including catering staff in older people's care
homes, should have training to give them an understanding of the specific
Keeping active in later life helps to strengthen muscles, maintain mobility
and balance and improves insulin sensitivity. It can help you to continue to
self-care, can improve your mental well-being and prevent falls. You can aim
to be as active as you are able.
Older people, including those with frailty, have been shown to benefit from
light resistance and balance training. Exercise to build limb strength and
flexibility for those who are housebound and confined to a bed or chair can be
taught by a physiotherapist and supported by carers. Remember to check with
Hypoglycaemia or hypo occurs at blood glucose levels of less than 4mmols/l.
Older people may have added risk factors which can lead to hypo:
Many older people find their hypo warning symptoms become less obvious, and
some have no symptoms at all. This may mean that the first signs noticed by a
Hypos which go unnoticed can cause very unpleasant symptoms:
A hypo should be treated immediately in a conscious person with fast-acting
glucose, such as a sugary (non-hot, non-milky) drink or some glucose tablets
and followed up with something starchy like biscuits, a sandwich or the next
meal. If someone is unconscious, call for medical help or an ambulance.
For older people in care homes a personal hypo box with hypo treatments and
instructions for treatment can be kept at hand.
To prevent hypos, it is helpful to have regular mealtimes and snacks
containing carbohydrate and to be aware of hypo symptoms and what to look out
for in individuals who may be at risk. Target levels for blood glucose control
should not be too tight and medication must be right for the individual. This
Blood glucose monitoring can help to identify older people who may be at risk
of hypos but must always be looked at together with longer term blood results
Residential settings providing care for people with diabetes should have a
diabetes policy which includes management and prevention of hypos, diabetes
care plans for individuals and diabetes skills training for staff.
Depression is more common in people with long-term conditions but may go
unnoticed in older people with complex health problems. Painful neuropathy,
foot ulceration and adverse effects of medication can all contribute to
depression. The risk of dementia also increases with age. Anything which
affects your mental well-being may affect your ability to successfully manage
Simple tests are available from your GP to screen for depression or dementia.
Recognizing these issues at an early stage can help limit their longer term
For older people living in care homes, screening on admission and annually is
recommended. If you are living with diabetes and dementia, Living with
Diabetes and Dementia is a helpful guide with practical tips.
Older people with diabetes, particularly those living in care homes may be
more likely to be admitted to hospital when they are unwell. This is because
diabetes can have an additional effect on the illness and the illness can
Blood glucose can rise quickly during illness, particularly in older people
who are dehydrated. Extra monitoring and medication may be required and carers
may need to give you extra support. It is important that there is guidance for
carers in your personal care plan. This should also show very clearly when
If you do have to go to hospital it is very helpful to take a copy of the care
plan with you so that staff can easily see your diabetes medical history and
Physical changes as you grow older may affect your ability to self-care. As
changes can occur at any time they may also indicate that something should be
investigated as you may need a change of medication.
Age is the most significant factor for common eye conditions like glaucoma,
cataract and macular degeneration. Failing eyesight and reduced mobility may
lead to a reduced level of daily foot care, meaning early problem signs are
missed. Urinary incontinence can be a symptom of many conditions, including
poorly controlled diabetes and changes in kidney function.
It is easy to assume that symptoms are simply due to the ageing process or
because you have diabetes. However, it is important to seek advice for any new
symptoms and to ask for support where self-care and monitoring has become
