stress, feeling low and depressed, or burnt out. The people around you can
feel all of this too. Whatever you're feeling, you are not alone. Here's some
information you might find helpful – you might like to share it with your

* check out your work policies around sickness and time off
* know the symptoms of coronavirus and what to do if you begin to feel ill
* make sure you have supplies and repeat prescriptions up to date
* look after your body – try to make healthy food choices, be active, get enough sleep and wash your hands more often
* check out our recipe finder for new ideas
* make sure to look after your mind if you're staying at home – keep in touch with friends and family if you can
* say no to things if you need to, and ask for help if you feel you need it
* get your news from reliable sources, but it’s also okay to take a break from the news if it feels too much.
Focusing your mind on things out of your control won't change things. This can
lead to worry, so gently try to redirect your attention.
You might be feeling nervous, because your condition may make you more
vulnerable to becoming unwell if you catch coronavirus. Or you might be
worrying about who around you could catch the virus. But you don’t have
control over these things, so try to be supportive and understanding for the
people who do get coronavirus. And remember that it is not your fault if you
catch the virus too. Be kind and compassionate to yourself.

Talking about diabetes and how it's making you feel isn’t always easy. It can
be hard to get started, or find someone you think you can open up to. Maybe

burden anyone. But offloading some of what you're feeling has so many
benefits, both for you and for those close to you.

Being diagnosed with diabetes can come as a shock. First reactions may be
disbelief, feeling overwhelmed, even anger. Usually these feelings ease after

Hypoglycaemia or a hypo is when your blood glucose level (blood sugar) goes
too low. Not everyone with diabetes can get hypos, but some often worry or get
anxious about having them. If these feelings don't go away or start to take
over your daily life, then it's important you talk to someone about it. Find
out how to work through your hypo anxiety.
Diabetes can put more of a focus on food and diet. Having to pay close to
attention to what you eat and learn new ways to cook can be stressful. Some
people find they eat more when they're stressed or eat less because they're
feeling low. Eating different foods can have an impact on your mood too – find
out more about the link between your feelings and food.
Sometimes, it can mean more of a focus on weight and body image too. This can
lead to an unhealthy relationship with food, something called
disordered eating, or possibly an eating disorder. Diabulimia is a serious
eating disorder that people with Type 1 diabetes can develop. We've got more
information on diabulimia and what can help if you're struggling with it.
