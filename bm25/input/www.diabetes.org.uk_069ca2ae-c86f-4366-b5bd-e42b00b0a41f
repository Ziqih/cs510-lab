### Knowing your blood sugar levels helps you manage your diabetes and reduces
your risk of having serious complications – now and in the future.
Your blood sugar levels, also known as blood glucose levels, are a measurement
that show how much glucose you have in your blood. Glucose is a sugar that you
get from food and drink. Your blood sugar levels go up and down throughout the
day and for people living with diabetes these changes are larger and happen
more often than in people who don't have diabetes.
You can check your sugar levels yourself by doing a finger-prick test, by
using a flash glucose monitor or with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). You
can do this a number of times a day – helping you keep an eye on your levels
as you go about your life and help you work out what to eat and how much
medication to take. Find out your ideal target range.
But not everyone with diabetes needs to check their levels like this. You’ll
need to if you take certain diabetes medication. Always talk to your
healthcare team if you’re not sure whether that’s you – they’ll give you
advice on whether to check them yourself and how often.
And there’s also something called an HbA1c, which measures your average blood
sugar level from the previous few months. Everyone with diabetes is entitled
High blood sugar levels increase your risk of developing serious
complications. However you manage your diabetes, stay in the know about your
If you take certain medication, like insulin or sulphonylureas, checking your
blood sugars is a vital part of living with diabetes. It can help you work out
when you need to take more medication, when you need to eat something or for
when you want to get up and move around more.
Routine checks can help you know when you might be starting to go too low
(called a hypo) or too high (called a hyper). It’s a way of getting to know
your body and how it works. It can help you and your healthcare team spot
patterns too. Do you write your results down? You might find that helpful.
But importantly, it will help you stay healthy and prevent serious diabetes
complications now and in the future. By complications, we mean serious
problems in places like your feet and your eyes. This happens because too much
sugar in the blood damages your blood vessels, making it harder for blood to
flow around your body. This can lead to very serious problems like sight loss

you’re taught how to do it properly – otherwise you could get the wrong
For some people, finger-prick testing isn’t a problem and it quickly becomes
part of their normal routine. For others, it can be a stressful experience,
and that’s totally understandable. Knowing all the facts and speaking to other
people can help – contact our helpline or chat to others with diabetes on our
online forum. They’ve been through it too and will understand your worries.

You’ll need these things to do the test:
* a lancet (a very short, fine needle)
* a sharps bin, so you can throw the needles away safely.
If you’re missing one of these, speak to your healthcare team.
New meters come on the market all the time, so it can be tricky choosing the
right one. It’s best to ask your healthcare team for advice on a meter that’ll
If you have sight problems, you may not be able to use some meters so your
Some people can get meters on prescription. But if you choose to buy your own
meter, you might not get a prescription for the test strips it uses. Chat to
Test strips usually come in batches of 50 and must work with the type of meter
But about one in four people in the UK have had a GP who’s refused to
prescribe test strips. We think this is unacceptable so we’re campaigning for
everyone to have access to test strips on prescription.
If this happens to you, take it up with your GP practice. If that doesn’t
work, contact your local Clinical Commissioning Group (your local CCG manages
If you decide to buy strips from outside the UK or online, you’ll need to
Finger-prick devices pierce the skin with a needle so that a drop of blood can
be taken for testing. The needle is called a lancet.
You can adjust the device to change how far it goes into the skin. It’ll
Lancets come in different sizes and thicknesses (or gauges). A higher-gauge
lancet is thinner so is normally less painful, but it might not always give
You can only use a lancet once or they get blunt and are painful to use.
Your healthcare team will show you how to do it the first time, but these are
* Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Don’t use wet wipes as the glycerine in them can affect the test result. Make sure your hands are warm so it’s easier to get blood and won’t hurt as much.
* Take a test strip and slot it into the meter to turn it on. Some meters will have tests strips built in. 
* Remove the cap from your finger prick device and put in a new lancet. Then put the cap back on and set the device by pulling or clicking the plunger.
* Choose which finger to prick but avoid your thumb or index finger (finger next to your thumb). And don’t prick the middle, or too close to a nail. Place the device against the side of your finger and press the plunger. Use a different finger each time and a different area.
* Take your meter with the test strip and hold it against the drop of blood. It’ll tell you if the test strip is filled, usually by beeping.
* Before you look at your reading, check your finger. Use a tissue to stop bleeding, then use it to take out the lancet and throw it away in your sharps bin.
* By this time, your meter will probably show the result. Note it down.
* You can use the same tissue to take out the test strip and throw that away too. Taking out the strip will usually turn the meter off.
More and more people with diabetes are choosing to use a flash glucose monitor
to check their sugar levels. It’s a sensor you wear on your skin and you don’t
have to prick your finger to use it. The main brand is called the FreeStyle
But flash glucose monitoring doesn’t measure the sugar in your blood. It
measures the amount of sugar in the fluid surrounding your cells, called
interstitial fluid. This causes a delay with the reading so it’s not
completely accurate, so you’ll still need to do a finger-prick test every now
We've been campaigning to make this life-changing technology more easily
available – check out our Fight for Flash campaign.
As well as regularly testing your own blood sugars, at least once a year your
healthcare team will ask you to come in for an HbA1c test. This checks your
average blood sugar levels and helps your diabetes team and you spot trends
This is one of your essential diabetes health checks and it’s really important
you understand what your results mean. Even slightly high HbA1c levels can
lead to serious complications with your eyes, feet, heart and kidneys. So
don’t ignore it, stay in the know about your HbA1c.
We’ve got more information about the HbA1c test and what your levels mean.
It may sound obvious, but you must record your readings. Note them down in a
diary, a notebook or in your phone calendar. Some meters have software that
lets you do this. You could try a diabetes app too.
You and your healthcare team can then look back over your results to see if

These are blood sugar level targets for adults with type 1 and type 2
You might be asking, what's the normal range for blood sugar levels? The
answer is, there is a healthy range that you should ideally be aiming for. The

range for your blood sugar levels may be different. You’ll healthcare team
You’ll get different readings at different times of the day, depending on
things like what you’ve eaten and how much you are moving around. Here’s a
guide to help you get started on finding your target range:
#### If you’re a child with Type 1 diabetes
* when you wake up and before meals: 4 to 7mmol/l
#### If you’re an adult with Type 1 diabetes
* when you wake up and before meals: 5 to 7mmol/l
* before meals at other times of the day: 4 to 7mmol/l
* two hours after meals: less than 8.5mmol/l
* If you’re not able to check until two hours – rather than one hour – after a meal, you should aim for below 6.4mmol/l.
> mmol/l stands for millimoles per litre. A mole is a scientific unit often
If you’re pregnant and have diabetes, your targets will be different. We have

### What happens when your blood sugar levels are too low?
If your blood sugar levels are too low, usually below 4 mmol/l, you may
experience a hypo. Hypos need to be treated immediately, otherwise your blood
sugar levels will drop further. If this happens, you may experience a severe
There are many different symptoms of a hypo, so it’s important that you are
aware of the signs in case your blood sugar level gets too low. We’ve also got

no symptoms. But if your blood sugar levels become too high, you may
The blood sugar level at which symptoms begin to appear is different for
everyone, but the common symptoms include passing more urine than normal,
being very thirsty, having headaches and feeling tired and lethargic.
It’s important that you know how to treat a hyper to avoid developing ketones
