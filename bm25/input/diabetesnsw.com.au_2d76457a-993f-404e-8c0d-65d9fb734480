When Sue found herself in two weeks of enforced quarantine in a Sydney Hotel,
the 70-year-old, who lives with diabetes, picked up the phone and called our
Helpline. Sue spoke to Donna, one of our Credentialed Diabetes Educators.

quarantine. I wanted to know exactly what we could have when it came to meals.
I was also worried about exercise, as we were not allowed to leave our rooms
“Donna put me onto another fellow, an exercise physiologist at Diabetes
NSW&ACT. I’m limited in what I can do because my back was operated on and I

here for people living with all types of diabetes.
