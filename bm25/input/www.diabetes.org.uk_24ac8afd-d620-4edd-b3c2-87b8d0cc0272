>>>>>>> The Express reported in January 2013 that scientists found that
carrots are packed with potent health-boosting antioxidants that seem to
>>>>>>> We already know that eating a healthy, balanced diet and keeping to a
healthy weight are key to reducing the risk of Type 2.
>>>>>>> However, the new findings shed light on the interaction between our
genes and the content of the foods we eat and their impact on our risk of
>>>>>>> Researchers from Stanford University in California found that, in
people with particular common genetic variations, high blood levels of beta
carotene, which the body converts to a form of vitamin A, might lower the risk
>>>>>>> They also found that high levels of gamma tocopherol (the major form
of vitamin E in the diet, found in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds and
wholegrains), might increase the risk of Type 2.
>>>>>>> The research, published in the journal Human Genetics, focused on the
interactions that occur between the specific genetic variations found in
different individuals and blood levels of key substances that have previously
been linked to an increased risk of Type 2.
>>>>>>> On their own, none of the genetic factors showed an impressive impact
on Type 2 risk. But when paired with the antioxidants, there were significant
>>>>>>> In people carrying a double dose of a specific variation (in the gene
SLC30A4), which is known to increase the risk of Type 2, researchers found
clear links between high blood levels of beta carotene and a reduced risk of
Type 2. Whereas, the variations combined with high blood levels of gamma
tocopherol were linked to an increased risk of the condition.
>>>>>>> These findings highlight the need for further studies to find out if
beta carotene and gamma tocopherol are protective or harmful themselves, or if
they are simply markers associated with the true causes of Type 2.
>>>>>>> Dr Richard Elliott, Diabetes UK’s Research Communications Officer,
said, "This tells us more about the genetic and environmental factors that
cause Type 2 diabetes, but doesn’t provide enough evidence for us to recommend
changes to the vitamin content of a person’s diet.
>>>>>>> "Large-scale research is needed to detail how external elements, such
as certain foods, interact with genes to increase a person’s risk of
>>>>>>> "What we already know is that following a healthy, balanced diet and
taking regular physical activity is the best way of reducing Type 2 risk."
