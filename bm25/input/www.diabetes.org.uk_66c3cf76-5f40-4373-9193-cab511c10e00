>>>>>>> Diagnosis was a real low point. I had just found out I was pregnant
>>>>>>> At a routine check-up at eight weeks, the nurse did a pin-prick test
of my blood and my sugars were 19mmol/l. My dad, Harish, had type 2 diabetes,
so I knew that was high. I was referred to Barnet General Hospital and saw a
doctor who specialised in diabetic pregnancies. I was put on metformin and
insulin injections straight away. It was a huge shock.
>>>>>>> Things got worse when I suffered a miscarriage at 12 weeks. The day we
announced my pregnancy to the world was the day I lost my baby. I conceived
again within six months, but was terrified of having another miscarriage the
whole time. I spent a lot of time hungry in my pregnancy, because I was so
scared to eat. I was petrified to eat anything because it would make my blood
>>>>>>> In my culture, there’s this idea that if you are sick, disabled or
impaired in some way, then it’s your fault. So, you’re under pressure to deal
with it yourself, quietly, behind closed doors. If you talk about your health
problems, it would be shameful for your family for everyone to know and to
>>>>>>> So for years I carried on, battling with food, battling with life,
>>>>>>> When I was diagnosed with diabetes, I only told my immediate family –
my husband, sisters, parents and in-laws – about my condition.
>>>>>>> My dad’s brothers, who I was really close to and who were also
diabetic, would come to our house and I’d look after them, but they didn’t
>>>>>>> I isolated myself to protect my sanity, because telling people would
have meant explaining that while I’d thought ‘big was beautiful,’ maybe
everyone was right. Maybe it was my fault and it was all because of my
>>>>>>> Diabetes impacted my marriage too. I completely lost my self-esteem
and any feelings of attractiveness. Everything became so medicinal - the
injecting, the hypos. My husband was my carer and it did not feel like a
sexual or romantic relationship. Diabetes became the third person in our
>>>>>>> ###Take control and get the support you need for managing diabetes
>>>>>>> We all have highs and lows. Get practical tools on staying emotionally
>>>>>>> Emotionally, I was broken. I thought life was over.
>>>>>>> When I was growing up, my parents ran a post office, and my siblings
and I didn’t ever go out of the house. There was no physical activity. There
were no ballet or gymnastics classes. Mum didn’t drive, so we’d go to school
and come back. Eating was the highlight of the day.
>>>>>>> At school and college, I was always the ‘fat girl’. But I was also the
fun girl. People loved spending time with me. I was huge, but had no problem
finding friends or romantic interests.. Life was great. I didn’t feel any need
>>>>>>> My auntie, Yogini, whose father had diabetes (my grandfather), used to
do 5k and 10k runs to raise money for Diabetes UK and many other charities.
She asked if I’d like to join her. She’d encourage me to be active and invite
me out for runs, but I’d only do it occasionally. I didn’t really like
running, but then three years ago, my niece was badly burnt by a cup of tea. I
was so angry about it, I started running and I didn’t stop.
>>>>>>> My weight went down to 11 stone and my blood sugar control was good.
Then, in 2017, I broke my toe and couldn’t run. I began to put weight back on.
>>>>>>> This time, when I got to 12 stone, my body objected and I needed to
start taking insulin again. Within months I was on Bydureon (a weekly
injectable medication for type 2 diabetes), and maximum oral medication
>>>>>>> The Bydureon injections controlled my blood sugars, but they hurt and
made me sick. I had welts on my tummy that were incredibly sore.
>>>>>>> At that time my father-in-law, Shanker, decided to lose weight to
raise money for charity. I decided I wanted to join him. I knew I couldn’t
run, but I thought if I could improve my diet, I could possibly shift a little
>>>>>>> For years, I flitted between following diets by WeightWatchers, which
I did as a teenager, and Slimming World, but I just couldn’t lose weight. I’d
hear people say they’d followed the Slimming World diet and their sugars had
got better or they’d put their diabetes into remission and I’d think,
‘really?!’ I was convinced diabetes was not that easy to manage or beat. I
thought it might work for someone who’d just been diagnosed, but not for
someone like me, who’d had diabetes for 10 years. But lo and behold, it did.
>>>>>>> I adopted the basic rule of having half a plate of salad, a quarter
plate of protein and a quarter plate of complex carbs at every meal.

>>>>>>> My biggest challenge has been thinking about my daughters and how
diabetes might affect them. I never want this for them, not the stigma and not
the diabetes. But I have to be practical and prepare them, just in case
diabetes comes into their lives in the future.
>>>>>>> Teaching them and guiding them through my journey and being honest and
transparent with them hasn’t always been easy. Children always ask questions –
and expect answers, so I’ve had to educate myself before I can them.
>>>>>>> They challenge your perceptions and the hope for a bright future for
them, makes me want to persevere and try harder to improve my own prognosis,
>>>>>>> I used to read about diabetes, but I didn’t have the energy to reach
out to talk to anyone. I felt ashamed of my condition.
>>>>>>> When my diabetes was bad, I told my mum, Daxa, that I wanted to tell
my wider family that I was really ill. She tried to discourage me, because she
>>>>>>> That was the point when I realised it was important not to suffer in
silence any longer. If you have diabetes, you have to talk about it. If you’re
not talking about it, nothing's changing… not the outcomes and not the
>>>>>>> It doesn’t matter what culture you’re from, or what gender you are. If
you cannot accept you have a medical condition, you cannot deal with it. Being
more open means a lot to me and I feel strongly about it.
>>>>>>> Losing weight and putting my diabetes into remission gave me a new
confidence to speak out about my condition. With any other condition or
illness, there is sympathy and people are supportive. I wish the same could be
said for diabetes, that there was more compassion and less blame.
>>>>>>> In 2018, I wrote a blog about my journey to remission and afterwards,
hundreds of people messaged me, thanking me for telling them how to eat
healthier, and encouraging them helped them to make similar changes
>>>>>>> Despite everything my family have always been my go-to people. They

>>>>>>> The NHS BMI chart is a really good tool. It takes into account your
ethnicity and ideal weight for protecting yourself against diabetes. I also
use apps like MySugr, which is great for monitoring and recording your meals

times, distances and calories burned and 7 Min Workout.
