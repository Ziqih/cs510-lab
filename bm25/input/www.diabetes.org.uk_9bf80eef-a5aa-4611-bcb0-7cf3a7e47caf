## Working with her local community to set up support groups
Phyllis has been volunteering for the last 18 months as a Group Support
Volunteer. Having been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes for 46 years, she got
involved with Diabetes UK to help others and increase awareness and
I very much enjoy being part of the team of volunteers within the Midlands
group, and have met some lovely and very dedicated people. Roy Bustin
(Volunteer Coordinator for East Midlands) in particular has been extremely
helpful. It makes a huge difference in sharing with team members and
volunteers what it’s like living with diabetes, whether Type 1 or Type 2 and
### What impact has volunteering had on you and/or your local community?
I helped set up a local diabetes group in South Derbyshire, having met with
the Swadlincote CVS and have been attending other local groups in Burton and
Derby in order to establish contacts within these local communities too.
### What would you say to someone thinking about volunteering?
I would encourage anyone who is thinking of volunteering for Diabetes UK to
pick up the phone. It's a great way to be involved with other people living
with diabetes and be supported and part of a team that ultimately makes one
feel less alone in dealing with diabetes. Many thanks to Diabetes UK, it has
been a great 18 months and I look forward to continuing my volunteering role.
