Did you know about 28% of Australian adolescents with type 1 diabetes meet the
diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder – which can range from anorexia to
bulimia, binge eating, excessive exercise or nutrient restriction. What isn’t
often exposed at diagnosis is how much diabetes can affect the perception of
body image for people living with the condition. It affects those with type 1
We recently asked some of Diabetes NSW & ACT's ambassadors to share how living
with diabetes has affected their body image and here's what they had to say…
I put on a lot of weight after my diagnosis despite following all the
recommendations from my dietitian, endocrinologist and diabetes educator which
had me rigorously controlling my blood glucose levels and measuring the
kilojoules and carbohydrates I was eating each day.
So I took up yoga, pilates and zumba and started controlling my food intake
tightly in the hopes of reducing my weight gain. Eventually I was starving
myself to minimise my kilojoule intake and binge eating because of sugar
cravings. The day I tried to make myself throw up – I knew something had to
The journey back from my negative body image and tight food control has been a
gradual process. Over time I’ve improved my body image through my own research
and I now have a lifestyle that controls my weight and BGLs healthily and lets
I had always been petite in weight and height (4 ft 9), and found it difficult
to accept that I had gained 20kg in four years. For seven years I knew
something was wrong and experts would only tell me to eat well and exercise.
No matter what I tried I kept gaining weight. By the time I was diagnosed with
type 2 diabetes, I weighed 73kg and was size 18.
Shortly after diagnosis I attended an education program run by Diabetes NSW &
ACT where I learned to how to eat healthier and exercise. My medication helped
me regain energy, which gave me the motivation and ability to become active
When I started dancing I wore a hoodie and tights to my first class because I
was so self conscious about how I looked. I was sweltering in September! After
the first class I was hooked – I’d found my passion! I started dancing 9 to 10
hours a week and combined with medication and healthy eating, I lost 15kg in
I was healthy, athletic and in my second year of high school - eating a pack
of Weet-Bix a day. But when I lost 14kg in a week and knew something was
I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes which affected my body image a lot. I
dealt with it largely on my own because I felt no one understood and it was
hard. Since finishing high school I've studied Civil Engineering, played
My wife and I started a personal training business together – Recipe for
Health – which was inspired from my experiences with diabetes.
When I was diagnosed with type 1, I spent my fifth birthday in hospital and I
think I was allowed a piece of cake. Once I was home though, things changed.
My parents were doing their best to protect me. I would say that over the
years though, the knowledge that I 'can't' eat certain things has led me to
sneaking them, hiding, and bingeing those foods. This has led to me carrying a
bit more weight than I probably should at times, but then when I've
participated in exercise regimes the weight hasn't come off like it did for
Learning that weight management and insulin is a complicated road has been
demotivating, especially when my blood glucose levels tend to stay more level
when I stay away from intense exercise! I try to at least complete gentle
exercise so that my insulin becomes more effective.
In the last couple of years I've experienced insulin resistance, or 'double
diabetes' which has put my insulin doses up and caused me to put on weight. I
refuse to give up though and will be re-joining my boxing classes this year!
I was diagnosed with type 1 when I was 12, so body image was becoming a major
influence in my life. I was never overweight, but I rarely took my shirt off
because I felt that girls and especially my peers would laugh at me because
all the other boys had a six pack and I had a tyre of fatty insulin cells
At this point I started going to the gym and doing weights and started
researching and educating myself about the relationship between constructed
meal plans and diabetes. I found a coach from the United States who also has
type 1 diabetes and life got better. My body weight and body fat changed – and
I had the best HBA1c I’d ever had, plus my stomach went down due to less
In some ways diabetes has been a blessing in disguise as I wouldn’t be where I
am today without it – Mr Australasia in the BodyBuilding Federation and a
The most difficult issues that I have encountered would be the stigma of being
a diabetic. The question I dislike more than anything would be is “do you have
diabetes because you were/are fat?” or “Is it because you eat unhealthy” For
I didn’t like that people presumed that I had caused my diabetes because of
some unhealthy habits, considering I was diagnosed when I was only two years
old. Although I'm by no means skinny, I have never been an overly large or
unhealthy person. This stigma caused a problematic relationship between my
There was a struggle between being healthy and having controlled diabetes, and
trying to have that perfect body image by dieting and detoxing. There is also
the vicious cycle with taking insulin – the more insulin you give yourself the
more weight you put on but the larger you are the more insulin you actually
need to take to control your sugar levels.
It was hard being a teenage girl with diabetes. I would skip meals, which
obviously had negative effects on my sugar levels and overall control but even
worse, I skipped insulin injections for a long time because I believed
reducing the amount of insulin I gave myself would help me lose weight.
Now I am older, I understand that everybody is different and I care less about
what other people think as long as I am happy with myself and my own body
image and that being healthy and having control should be the ultimate
ambition. Having this outlook has helped me achieve small goals that have
allowed me to get back on track with my diabetes management, and accepting my
diabetes and educating myself and other people has allowed me to teach
friends, family and colleagues about type 1 diabetes and get rid of the stigma
that diabetes is caused because you are overweight or unhealthy.
After I was diagnosed with diabetes my life and perspective of myself changed
in a very negative way. In the first few months of diagnosis I didn’t notice
any changes but after 6 months weight piled on. I went from being 43kg to 55kg
then 63kg in a matter of four years.
So I stopped injecting insulin in order to keep my body weight down and I used
all kinds of tricks to hide what I was doing from my endocrinologists.
Fortunately I had a top endocrinologist and she saw right through what I was
I ended up in an adult hospital at 17 years old, depressed and in an eating
disorder clinic. I was told if I did not bring my HBA1C down I would have to
stay in hospital and it could affect my ability to have children. My
endocrinologist adjusted my long-lasting insulin which had minimal effect on
my weight. It was through this experience that I realised my self-worth and
how important my health is to me. I made a commitment to myself to take better
care of my body and take control of my diabetes.
As you can see from this collection of stories, living with diabetes is not
easy and that can partly be because people have to juggle diet including
counting carbohydrates, fitting in exercise, taking medication and/or insulin.
