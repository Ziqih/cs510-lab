# Food Upfront - campaigning for clear food labelling
The UK government has recently announced that they will be introducing
legislation to make calorie labelling mandatory in larger cafes, takeaways and
restaurants and chains. This is one of the measures announced in Prime
Minister Boris Johnson's new plans to tackle obesity.
We welcome this announcement which marks a key milestone in our Food Upfront
campaign - but we will continue to push government to ensure that smaller food
businesses are supported to improve their nutritional information too.
## Why we have been campaigning on this issue
We know it's not easy to find out what’s in your food. Nine out of ten people
say clearer food labelling would help them make healthier food choices.
That's why our Food Upfront campaign called on the UK government and food
industry to act and make nutritional labelling clear, consistent and
In 2018 the UK government heard our calls, and launched a consultation on
proposals to make calorie labelling mandatory in restaurants, cafes and
And now, after many years of campaigning - and thanks to the attention you
helped us to bring to this issue - the Prime Minister has announced new
legislation will be introduced to make calorie labelling mandatory on food
sold in restaurants, cafes and takeaways employing more than 250 people.
The government have also committed to review and consider extending this
requirement to smaller businesses within 5 years, and we will continue to work
The government also announced a UK-wide review of front-of-pack labelling as
part of the new obesity strategy. This is a great opportunity for us to push
them to go further and make front-of-pack labelling mandatory on all packaged
food and drink. We'll be responding to the consultation to represent the views

food eaten out of the home and promised to work with the UK government to

## Taking action - the story so far
Thanks to your support, leading restaurants and the UK government have heard
the demand for stronger nutritional labelling. Here is what you have been
doing to help move us a step closer to clearer labelling.
In March 2018, almost 7,000 of you signed our petition, which is absolutely
amazing. With this many signatures, the message is crystal clear - it's time
for the government and industry to strengthen food labelling.
In April 2018 we took our cause to parliament to tell MPs why clear labelling
is so important. Hundreds of you wrote to your MP asking them to meet with us
and more than 50 MPs joined us and took action on the day.
In May 2018, we took our message directly to the Prime Minister by handing in
### 4\. The government publishing their Childhood Obesity Plan
On 24 June 2018, the Government published a second chapter of their Childhood
Obesity Plan. This includes proposals for clear, consistent and compulsory
calorie labelling that were consulted on over the autumn.
We’ve submitted our response to the government consultation. Thousands of you
shaped our response through focus groups in Cardiff, Glasgow, London and
### 6\. Getting restaurants, cafes and takeaways on board
We called on some of the biggest chains in the country to adopt the Food
Upfront pledge. We sent thousands of your letters to the biggest chains in the
country, urging them to improve their labelling. And some of them listened. We
had meetings with leading restaurant chains to discuss their food labelling.
### 7\. Urging the government not to delay
Hundreds of you responded to alarming media reports suggesting the government
were seeking to delay the publication of the calorie labelling consultation.
And nearly 2,000 people signed our open letter to the health minister urging
him to take action and publish the consultation.
We’ll keep calling for food labelling to be clear, consistent and compulsory.
And the more people we have participating in this campaign, the louder our
