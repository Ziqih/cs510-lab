>>>>>>> Professor Taylor will study whether weight loss in people with type 2
diabetes who aren’t obese can put their condition into remission. If the
researchers confirm this, it could change the advice given to people with type
2 of a normal weight and help them live well for longer.

to make insulin. It’s believed that too much fat around the pancreas could
>>>>>>> Professor Taylor has been working on the DiRECT study, with Professor
Lean, to find out if a structured weight management programme, which includes
a low-calorie diet, can put type 2 diabetes into remission in people who are
overweight. The first findings from DiRECT shown that around half of people
who tried this new approach were able to put their type 2 diabetes into
>>>>>>> DiRECT hopes to build on what we already know from studies in a small
number of volunteers. They have shown that low-calorie diets helped people
with type 2 to reduce the amount of fat in their liver and pancreas, helping
to restore their insulin production and put their type 2 diabetes into
>>>>>>> Professor Taylor wants to know if the same concept can help people
with type 2 diabetes who aren’t overweight. Unlike those with type 2 who are
obese, these people aren’t usually advised by their doctors to lose weight.
>>>>>>> Professor Taylor and his team will study whether a low-calorie diet
can help people with type 2 diabetes who aren’t obese to put their condition
>>>>>>> Participants will be asked to consume 800 calories a day (from soups,
shakes and non-starchy vegetables) for up to two weeks, whilst being
supervised by a medical team. After this, they’ll be supported to gradually
return to eating normal food and to keep off the weight they lost.
>>>>>>> They’ll be asked to repeat this cycle of a low-calorie diet and weight
loss maintenance up to three times. After each cycle, the research team will
measure the amount of fat in the pancreas and liver, and establish at which
point people may achieve type 2 remission. This can give a greater insight
into the biology behind type 2 diabetes, and why it may develop in people who
>>>>>>> ### Potential benefit to people with diabetes
>>>>>>> This research could help people with type 2 diabetes of a normal
weight put their condition into remission, potentially allowing them to stop
taking diabetes medications and live well for longer.
>>>>>>> Understanding more about how type 2 diabetes develops could also be
crucial for finding ways to prevent the condition in the future.
