# How to keep your weight stable during winter
During the winter months, it can be more challenging to dedicate time to
exercise as we begin to hibernate and seek warmth. We might also find we are
craving comfort foods that are rich, hearty and heavy in carbohydrates, to
keep our body warm and fight the winter blues.
Food can release a calming hormone called dopamine in the brain that makes us
feel better and takes the edge off a bad mood. The trouble comes when we begin
to rely on food to make us feel better and to soothe our emotions; it can
become a hardwired habit that is hard to break. However, with the right
mindset and steps towards regular physical activity combined with healthy
eating, the winter blues can be lifted with comforts other than foods. The
short, cold winter days don’t have to lead to larger waistlines.
##**Recognise your triggers by keeping a food diary**
Emotional eating can become an automatic behaviour, and breaking such a
pattern will require awareness. While it can be challenging, keep a food diary
and include what you eat, how much, when and how you are feeling when you eat,
as well as your hunger scale. This will help raise your awareness of habits,
identify triggers and patterns of connection between food and mood. Common
causes of emotional eating include stress, boredom, feelings of emptiness and
Habits develop as a default option. They don’t require too many decisions and
can be difficult to stop. But you can find ways to improve such habits by
tweaking them to provide a benefit. For example, if you are a snacker remove
unhealthy snacks from the cupboard and restock with healthy ones.
 **Don’t deprive yourself** – eating the same foods repeatedly and banishing
treats can increase cravings. Enjoy occasional treats but also eat a variety
 **Savour your food** – when you eat to feed your emotions, you tend to eat
quickly and mindlessly. It helps by slowing down and enjoying the texture,
taste and smell of your food. You will not only enjoy your food more but are
also less likely to overeat. So, practicing mindful eating by focussing on
your food and not eating while you are doing other things, such as watching
 **Rethink your hunger-fullness scale** (see below) – many of us have lost
touch with what hunger feels like. If you are unsure whether the hunger is
real or due to emotional triggers, try rating your hunger and fullness on a
scale. This will make you more aware of what physical hunger means to you.

* Make time for relaxation – give yourself permission to take at least 30 minutes every day to relax and unwind. Learning to breathe slowly and deeply can be an excellent start to calm the mind
* See a psychologist – a psychologist can assist you to learn to manage stress without the involvement of food.
Some people find relief from the winter blues or stress by getting regular
exercise. Exercise causes the release of feel good chemicals, called
Walking and cycling are great exercise options during winter, provided you
dress warmly and incorporate an extended warm up (10-15 minutes). This allows
you to prepare your muscles and joints for your activity of choice and reduces
any risk of injury. Or consider doing some muscle building exercises. Have a
think about things you can do with your own body weight or with objects around
the house that can be used as resistance for example, cans of food, water
