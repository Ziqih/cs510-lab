# Children’s school performance is not impaired by type 1 diabetes
Primary school aged children with type 1 diabetes have educational outcomes
similar to their peers without diabetes, according to a South Australian study
that was reported in a recent edition of The Limbic.
The findings should alleviate concerns about blood glucose variability,
impaired cognitive function and diabetes-related school absences having an
adverse effect on academic ability, according to researchers at Adelaide
Their comparison of year 5 NAPLAN scores for numeracy and literacy in 61,445
children, including a subset of 162 children with type 1 diabetes, found
negligible differences between those with and without diabetes.
The study found differences in mean reading, writing and numeracy scores of
the children with and without type 1 diabetes were around one tenth of a
standard deviation – equivalent to less than one mark in the raw NAPLAN
It also found there were negligible differences in the mean reading, writing,
spelling, grammar and numeracy scores according to time since their type 1
The findings were consistent with recent schools based performance studies
from Western Australia and Denmark, but contrasted with other studies,
including older studies, which used cognitive measures and IQ scores.
The study authors said it was thought type 1 diabetes could potentially affect
a child’s memory and concentration due to the challenges of managing blood
Type 1 could also have longer term effects on brain volumes and altered neural
pathways, and they noted, that some children with type 1 diabetes have shown
attention, problem solving capacity, and visual motor integration.
“Improvements in type 1 diabetes management, diabetes education programs for
school staff, and perhaps increasing use of insulin pumps due to government
subsidy in recent years may have helped children in achieving better glycaemic
They also noted that the legal obligation for schools to make reasonable
adjustments to encourage participation of children with diabetes may help them
reach their potential and achieve similar educational outcomes as children
The authors noted the study included only children attending public schools
but that educational attainment was usually similar in both public and private
“This whole-of-population study demonstrated that South Australian children
with type 1 diabetes are not disadvantaged on educational outcomes in year 5
compared to children without type 1 diabetes,” they concluded.
“This supports the idea that the negative effects of type 1 diabetes on
educational outcomes may have equalised possibly through improved type 1
