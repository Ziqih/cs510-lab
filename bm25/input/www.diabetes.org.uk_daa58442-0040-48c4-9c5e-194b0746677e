>>>>>>> Laura, 24, and Zoe, 26, have been friends all their lives. We asked
them to open up about their friendship and the difference that having great
friends can make – especially when Laura had the shock of her Type 1 diabetes
>>>>>>> Growing up, Zoe was always the cool one who knew everything and had
the best sense of style. We’d put on talent shows and fashion shows together,
and I went to my first gig with her. I still run my outfit choices past her
>>>>>>> **When did you first talk to Zoe about Type 1?**
>>>>>>> Zoe was the first person I text after my diagnosis. I was left alone
in an examination room at the doctors and was frantically texting anyone who
could offer immediate comfort. I knew she’d reply straightaway and tell me
>>>>>>> She came over the next morning to give me a big hug and talk it
through. It was so comforting to know that this massive thing that had
completely taken me by surprise was affecting her enough to drop everything
and come running over to make me feel better.
>>>>>>> She’s always understanding when I need to go home and sleep off my
pizza carb coma. She never lectures me about eating dessert. She’s my
therapist when I have bad days, bad appointments, bad experiences, and always
>>>>>>> **Tell us about a happy memory with Zoe.**
>>>>>>> The first time I went out for dinner after being diagnosed was to a
Mexican restaurant with Zoe. My whole life had changed but she was still
there, telling me it was okay to get medical equipment out at the dinner
table. We were also wearing sombreros, so it was impossible to be sad about my
>>>>>>> The weeks after I was diagnosed she was a godsend, distracting me most
days. Whether it was a cinema trip, dinner date or just a cuppa and cake, she
made me feel normal, when my normal had completely changed.
>>>>>>> **What your advice for anyone who’s mates with someone with Type 1?**
>>>>>>> Download a carb counting app so if their mobile battery dies or they
don’t have signal, you can be a backup. Keep a stash of their favourite hypo
treatment about. And whatever you do, never give them stick for eating

>>>>>>> Laura and I have known each other our entire lives, as our mums are
childhood friends. I think that gives us a true, solid friendship what I know
many people aren’t lucky enough to experience. Our friendship really blossomed
in our late teens when we started hanging out a lot independently of our
>>>>>>> **How did Laura first talk to you about Type 1?**
>>>>>>> Laura texted me from the doctors, just as she was about to be sent to
A&E. My first reaction was sheer devastation for Laura. I had an uncle pass
away from Type 1 complications so I knew how truly life changing this would
>>>>>>> In the first few months I tried to learn as much as I could about Type
1. I felt upset that one of my best friends had the bad luck to be dealt this
>>>>>>> I remember Laura having to hear about the struggles she may encounter
if she wants to have children – not something a woman in her early twenties
>>>>>>> I hope I support her as much as I can – from small things like tasting
her popcorn in the cinema to see if it’s as sweet as usual to checking she
hasn’t injected too much insulin to getting a place in the 2018 London
>>>>>>> Laura’s bravery inspires me. She has taken this diagnosis with so much
strength and grace. In the first few weeks after diagnosis she was signed off
work and temporarily banned from driving. These were extra blows that took
away her independence. I wanted to keep her smiling by driving her places,
buying her silly fuzzy socks and supporting the decisions she made about her
Type 1. There is no doubt Type 1 knocks you down sometimes and I want to be
there to bring her back up. There may be tears sometimes after her diabetes
appointments, but I’m here for those tears, silent hugs and tension-breaking
>>>>>>> We have so many happy memories together it’s hard to pick just one.
One summer that sticks in mind is 2012, when I’d just got my new car – a Mini.
It was so exciting for us both and we just drove and drove along country lanes
