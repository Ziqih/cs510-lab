More Australians are being hospitalised each year for diabetes complications
that could potentially be avoided by earlier diagnosis and better management.
The rate of potentially preventable hospitalisations due to diabetes
complications has risen 4% between 2017-18 in Australia, while the rate of
hospitalisations for other chronic conditions has decreased.[i] This means

Mr Eastwood said the increase in the rates of preventable hospitalisations
because of diabetes complications could in part be due to people
underestimating the effects of untreated type 2 diabetes.
“The sooner you’re diagnosed, the sooner you can learn how to manage your
condition and delay or prevent complications. The next time you’re at the GP,
ask them to check for diabetes. Make a diabetes test part of your annual GP
