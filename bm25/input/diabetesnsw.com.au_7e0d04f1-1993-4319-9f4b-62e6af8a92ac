# Human stem cells cure diabetes in mice
A new technique to convert human stem cells into insulin-producing cells could
hold huge promise for the future treatment of diabetes. That is, if results
seen in a US based study with mice can be successfully replicated in humans.
During the study, researchers figured out a new way to coax human pluripotent
stem cells (hPSCs) into pancreatic beta cells that make insulin. When these
insulin-producing cells were transplanted into mice with an acute form of
Jeffrey R. Millman, biomedical engineer from Washington University explained,
that the mice had very severe diabetes with blood sugar readings of more than
500 milligrams per decilitre of blood. But when they were given the insulin-
secreting cells, within two weeks their blood glucose levels had returned to
normal and stayed that way for many months.
Pluripotent stem cells are essentially blank, undifferentiated cells with the
ability to grow into other kinds of cells that exist all throughout the body.
Harnessing that potential, means researchers could devise ways of tweaking
stem cells to become the insulin-producing cells to give people living with
diabetes more control of their blood glucose levels.
Scientists have been investigating how to do this for years, reporting a
number of incremental successes in animal models as our understanding of the
Millman's lab has been busy too. In 2016, they devised a way to produce
insulin-secreting cells – derived from people living with type 1 diabetes –
that functioned in response to glucose. A few years later, they learned how to
augment the level of insulin secretion in stem-cell-derived pancreatic beta
In the new work, they've tackled another challenge: reducing the amount of
'off target' cells produced in these processes, when blank cells differentiate
"A common problem when you're trying to transform a human stem cell into an
insulin-producing beta cell – or a neuron or a heart cell – is that you also
produce other cells that you don't want," Millman says.
"In the case of beta cells, we might get other types of pancreas cells or
These 'off target' cells are not harmful, but they're also not functional for
purposes like glucose control, which limits the remedial impact of stem cell
treatments, given you're working with less therapeutically relevant cells, the
However, a new technique now looks like it can keep cell differentiation on
target. In the new study, the team found that transcription factors that drive
stem cells towards becoming pancreatic cells are linked to the state of the
cell's cytoskeleton, a support structure inside cells that acts as a kind of
skeleton, made up of microfilaments of various protein fibres.
One of these proteins is called actin, which plays an important role in
cellular function, and, it turns out, cell differentiation as well.
"We found that manipulating cell–biomaterial interactions and the state of the
actin cytoskeleton altered the timing of endocrine transcription factor
expression and the ability of pancreatic progenitors to differentiate into
stem-cell-derived beta cells," the authors explain in their paper.
In other words, we can more efficiently ensure the production of insulin-
producing cells by controlling the actin cytoskeleton, and the ability to do
that bodes well for the future of stem cell treatments, if the team's mouse
"We were able to make more beta cells, and those cells functioned better in
the mice, some of which remained cured for more than a year," Millman
explains; control animals, who were not given the cell transplants, ended up
dying, such was the severity of their induced diabetes.
That's not all. The same cytoskeletal manipulations also showed potential to
better control the differentiation of other kinds of cells, including liver,
oesophagus, stomach, and intestine cells, the researchers say. If so, the
technique might enhance stem cell treatments for other kinds of pathologies,
Of course, we can't get ahead of ourselves just yet, as the new method has so
far only been tested in animals; as the researchers emphasise, we're a long
way off being able to heal people with this kind of experimental treatment.
That said, the results are certainly promising, and could point the way to a
"Our study as a whole emphasises that cytoskeletal dynamics work
synergistically with soluble biochemical factors to regulate endodermal cell
fate, opening new opportunities to improve differentiation outcomes," the
