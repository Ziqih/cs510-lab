>>>>>>> When Giancarlo Caldesi was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2012, it
spurred him on to dramatically change his ways.
>>>>>>> In 2012, I was told I had Type 2 diabetes. At the time, I remember not
feeling well at all. I was tired, my eyes were sore, I had blurred vision and
intense thirst, despite drinking lots of water, and was making regular visits
to the loo. I was overweight and tubby around my belly.
>>>>>>> As a busy chef and restaurateur, I knew my lifestyle – and, in
particular, my carb and sugar-heavy diet – was to blame. Most days I’d drink
around 12 cappuccinos, with two sugars in each, up to lunchtime. Then, I’d
have an enormous portion of pasta for lunch. I loved puddings, too.
>>>>>>> When I was told I had diabetes, I dramatically changed my diet and
began regularly exercising. In four years, I’ve lost 2st and managed to get my
>>>>>>> When I found out my blood sugar levels were back within the normal
range, and my Type 2 diabetes was in remission, I felt disbelief. I thought,
>>>>>>> Now I’m 3 inches slimmer around the waist, and the symptoms have gone.
>>>>>>> Nowadays, my diet is very different. In the mornings, I have two eggs,
sometimes with a slice of gluten-free bread (two years ago, I found out I am
highly gluten intolerant), or perhaps scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, and a
>>>>>>> In fact, I have no refined sugar whatsoever anymore – I made that
decision overnight, and I’ve stuck to it. The reality is, though, to eat
healthy food, you have to think about it.
>>>>>>> The majority of supermarkets aren’t friendly environments to shop in –
it can be difficult to tell what’s good for you and what isn’t, so it’s a

>>>>>>> I was inspired to teach wheat-free, low-sugar and veg-packed dishes at
my cookery school, La Cucina Caldesi, which I opened with my wife Katie in
2005 (we met in 1996 and now own two restaurants together – Caffé Caldesi in
>>>>>>> We cook with fewer carbs and do a lot of vegetarian dishes, like
caponata from Sicily, fish dishes like seabass with cherry tomatoes and
chilli, garlic and parsley. We also make some lovely soups and teach people
how to make my gluten-free pasta, which goes down especially well.
>>>>>>> I eat out as much as I used to before, and we have takeaways as a
family (Katie and I have two sons, aged 14 and 16). But, I eat moderately and
tend to avoid coffee shops and patisseries unless I know they have something
>>>>>>> One thing I’ve learnt is to have less on your plate. If I’m at a
restaurant, I tend to keep it low carb with fish or a salad as a starter, then
for a main course, I’ll go for fish, chicken or beef. I stick to what’s on my
plate instead of having more than one portion and, if I have pasta, I have it
as a starter rather than a main course.
>>>>>>> Unfortunately, nothing can replace a good plate of pasta, but
motivation comes from results, and results mean a lot. For me, the result has
been losing weight and feeling much better. You have to be so determined, but
at the same time, you can’t be a prisoner within your own skin. You have to
