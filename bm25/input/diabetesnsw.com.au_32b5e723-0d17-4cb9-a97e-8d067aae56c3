# Diabetes increases risk of dementia and cancer
Australians living with type 2 diabetes have a 60 per cent higher chance of
developing dementia than those without diabetes, and are twice as likely to
develop some types of cancer, according to a new report analysing the full
Released today by the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, The Dark Shadow of
Type 2 Diabetes report shines light on high-risk areas that are becoming
The latest national snapshot of type 2 diabetes shows a better approach is
needed to address the wider health risks for the 1.5 million Australians
currently living with type 2 diabetes, especially the growing number of those
under 40 who may live with the disease for decades.
The report’s lead author and Head of Clinical Diabetes and Population Health
at the Baker Institute, Professor Jonathan Shaw said diabetes increased the
risk of numerous other diseases that most people may not understand were
“This is what we are calling ‘the dark shadow of type 2 diabetes’, as it can
cast a much wider shadow than many realise,” Professor Shaw said.
A recent meta-analysis involving data from two million people showed those
living with type 2 diabetes had a 60 per cent greater risk of developing
dementia compared to people without diabetes, with women more at risk than
Professor Shaw said people with type 2 diabetes were also more likely to
“They are two to three times more likely to develop pancreatic cancer – one of
the most deadly cancers – are twice as likely to develop liver or endometrial
cancer, have a 50 per cent higher chance of getting bowel cancer and a 20 per
cent greater risk of breast cancer,” he said.
“Increased cancer risk is of particular concern for the growing number of
people under 40 living with type 2 diabetes. This group saw a significant
increase in deaths from cancer between 2000 and 2011.”
On average, a 45 year old person with diabetes can expect to live six years
less than a person free of diabetes, and Professor Shaw said many of these
“Heart disease is still the biggest killer of people with type 2 diabetes, and
our report shows that heart failure is a leading cause,” he said.
“People with type 2 diabetes are up to eight times more likely to suffer from
But Professor Shaw said the report also highlighted recent advances around the
world showing that some of the newer diabetes medications had the potential to
significantly reduce the number of people with diabetes who develop heart and
“It’s vital that all those who could benefit from newer medications are
“With the burden of diabetes complications in our community casting such a
long shadow – in terms of death rates, disability and impact on the health
system – we need greater education and support for those living with diabetes,
“In addition to controlling blood sugar levels, it is essential Australians
living with type 2 diabetes are supported to keep blood pressure and
Other serious health implications outlined in The Dark Shadow of Type 2
* The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease is very high among people with type 2 diabetes, and can ultimately lead to liver failure and the need for liver transplants.
* Those with type 2 diabetes are 10 times more likely to develop kidney failure, than those without diabetes. For Indigenous Australians, diabetes is the primary cause of 70 per cent of all cases of kidney failure.
* Amputations remain a major complication of type 2 diabetes.
* Diabetic eye disease remains a leading cause of vision loss and blindness in working-age adults worldwide.
* A wide range of other diseases and conditions are also more common in people with diabetes, including depression, osteoporosis, sleep apnoea, hearing impairment and gum disease.
Researchers at the Baker Institute are currently working to understand more
about diabetes and how to prevent some of its devastating effects through
