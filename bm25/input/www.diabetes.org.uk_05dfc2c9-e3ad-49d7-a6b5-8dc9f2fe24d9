# What is a healthy, balanced diet for diabetes?
### **There is no specific diet for diabetes. But the foods you eat not only
make a difference to how you manage your diabetes, but also tohow well you
This information will help you get to know the five main food groups that make
How much you need to eat and drink is based on your age, gender, how active
you are and the goals you’re aiming for. But no single food contains all the
That’s why a healthy diet is all about variety and choosing different foods
from each of the main food groups every day.
And when we say balanced, we mean eating more of certain foods and less of
others. But portion sizes have grown in recent years, as the plates and bowls
we use have got bigger. And larger portions can make it more difficult for you
to manage your weight. We’ve got more information for you about managing a
We’ve highlighted the benefits of each food group below – some help protect
your heart and some affect your blood sugar levels more slowly – all really
important for you to know. Get to know them and how healthy choices can help

Having diabetes doesn’t mean you can’t have fruit. Fruit and veg are naturally
low in calories and packed full of vitamins, minerals and fibre. They also add
Fresh, frozen, dried and canned – they all count. Go for a rainbow of colours
to get as wide a range of vitamins and minerals as possible. Try to avoid
fruit juices and smoothies as they don’t have as much fibre.
If you’re trying to limit the amount of carbs you eat, you might be tempted to
avoid fruit and veg. But it’s so important to include them in your diet every
day. There are lower carb options you can try.
Fruit and vegetables can help protect against stroke, heart disease, high
blood pressure and some cancers – and when you have diabetes, you’re more at
* Help to keep your digestive system working well
* Help protect the body from heart disease, stroke and some cancers
Everyone should aim to eat at least five portions a day. A portion is roughly
what fits in the palm of your hand.
* sliced melon or grapefruit topped with unsweetened yogurt, or a handful of berries, or fresh dates, apricots or prunes for breakfast
* mix carrots, peas and green beans into your pasta bake
* add an extra handful of peas to rice, spinach to lamb or onions to chicken
* try mushrooms, cucumber, spinach, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, celery and lettuce for lower carb vegetable options
* try avocados, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, plums, peaches and watermelon for lower carb fruit options

Starchy foods are things like potatoes, rice, pasta, bread, chapattis, naan
and plantain. They all contain carbohydrate, which is broken down into glucose
and used by our cells as fuel. The problem with some starchy foods is that it
can raise blood glucose levels quickly, which can make it harder for you to
manage your diabetes. These foods have something called a high glycaemic index
(GI) – we’ve got loads more information about this.
There are some better options for starchy foods – ones that affect blood
glucose levels more slowly. These are foods with a low glycaemic index (GI),
like wholegrain bread, whole-wheat pasta and basmati, brown or wild rice. They
also have more fibre, which helps to keep your digestive system working well.
So if you’re trying to cut down on carbs, cut down on things like white bread,
* The fibre helps to keep your digestive system healthy
* Some affect your blood sugar levels more slowly
Try to have some starchy foods every day.
* two slices of multigrain toast with a bit of spread and Marmite or peanut butter
* brown rice, pasta or noodles in risottos, salads or stir-fries
* baked sweet potato with the skin left on – add toppings like cottage cheese or beans
* boiled cassava, flavoured with chilli and lemon
* chapatti made with brown or wholemeal atta.

## Protein foods like beans, nuts, pulses, eggs, meat and fish
Meat and fish are high in protein, which keeps your muscles healthy. But a
healthy diet means less red and processed meat – they’ve been linked to cancer
and heart disease. Oily fish like mackerel, salmon and sardines have a lot of
omega-3 oil, which can help protect the heart.
Aim to have some food from this group every day. Specifically at least 1 or 2
portions of oily fish each week. But you don’t need to eat meat every day.
* a small handful of raw nuts and seeds as a snack or chopped with a green salad 
* using beans and pulses in a casserole to replace some – or all – of the meat
* eggs scrambled, poached, dry fried or boiled – the choice is yours
* grilled fish with masala, fish pie, or make your own fishcakes
> We’ve got lots of healthy recipes to choose from – like our bean stew or try
Milk, cheese and yogurt have lots of calcium and protein in – great for your
bones, teeth and muscles. But some dairy foods are high in fat, particularly
Check for added sugar in lower-fat versions of dairy foods, like yoghurt. It’s
better to go for unsweetened yoghurt and add some berries if you want it
sweeter. If you prefer a dairy alternative like soya milk, choose one that’s
* a glass of milk straight, flavoured with a little cinnamon or added to porridge
* natural or unsweetened yogurt with fruit or on curry
* a bowl of breakfast cereal in the morning, with skimmed or semi-skimmed milk
* a cheese sandwich for lunch, packed with salad
* a refreshing lassi or some plain yogurt with your evening meal
We need some fat in our diet but we need less saturated fat. This is because
some saturated fats can increase cholesterol in the blood, increasing the risk
of heart diseases and stroke. These less healthy options are butter, palm nut
Healthier saturated fats are foods like olive oil, vegetable oil, rapeseed
oil, spreads made from these oils, and nut butters.
* A drizzle of olive oil on your salad 
* Peanut butter on your wholemeal toast 
## Foods high in fat, salt and sugar
You don’t need any of these as part of a healthy diet. The less often, the
better. But we know you’re bound to eat these foods from time to time, so it’s
really important to know how they might affect your body.
These foods include biscuits, crisps, chocolates, cakes, ice cream, butter and
sugary drinks. These sugary foods and drinks are high in calories and raise
blood sugar levels, so go for diet, light or low-calorie alternatives. And the
best drink to choose is water – it’s calorie free.
They’re also high in unhealthy saturated fats, so they aren’t good for
And they can also be full of salt – processed foods especially. Too much salt
can make you more at risk of high blood pressure and stroke. You should have
no more than 1 tsp (6g) of salt a day.
We don't recommend 'diabetic' ice cream or sweets. It's now against the law to
label any food as diabetic and there's no evidence to suggest that food for
diabetics offer any benefits over eating a healthy balanced diet.
* Cook more meals from scratch at home, where you can control the amount of salt you use.
* Check food labels – look for green and orange colours. We’ve got more information to help you read labels and we’re campaigning for things to get more consistent and less confusing.
* Try unsweetened teas and coffees – they’re better than fruit juices and smoothies as they don’t add any extra calories and carbs.
* Banish the salt shaker from the table – black pepper, herbs and spices are great ways of adding extra flavour to your food.
* Making your own sauces, like tomato ketchup and tandoori marinades.
