>>>>>>> # Can stress hormones protect beta cells?
>>>>>>> Professor David Hodson would like to understand how stress hormones,
called glucocorticoids, affect insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
Understanding how these stress hormones might be linked to Type 2 diabetes
might uncover new ways to treat the condition in the future.
>>>>>>> Glucocorticoids are stress hormones that work in the body to stop
inflammation. They’re produced and released by the adrenal gland, but
sometimes they can also be prescribed as a treatment for inflammatory
>>>>>>> Researchers think that high levels of these hormones might stop
insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas from working properly and reduce
the amount of insulin they make. In turn, this might contribute to the
>>>>>>> But recent data from Professor Hodson’s lab suggests that
glucocorticoids produced inside the body might actually protect beta cells.
They believe it’s not the stress hormones themselves that are harmful, but the
interaction between stress hormones and molecules of fat.
>>>>>>> Professor Hodson and his team think it might be possible to take
advantage of how stress hormones work and boost insulin production in people
>>>>>>> Professor Hodson will study how living beta cells behave when they
encounter stress hormones in the lab. He’ll also look at what happens when fat
>>>>>>> As cells grown in the laboratory don’t always behave the same way as
they do inside the body, the team will also study beta cells in mice. This
way, they can add build on the results they see in the lab.
>>>>>>> ### Potential benefit to people with diabetes
>>>>>>> With 3 million people living with Type 2 diabetes in the UK, we need
to make sure everyone has access to effective treatments. Understanding how
stress hormones and fats affect the pancreas could help us build a better
picture of what happens inside the body in people with Type 2 diabetes.
