>>>>>>>> When I was diagnosed with prediabetes in 2018, it came as a massive
>>>>>>> Michelle has always been athletic, so when she was diagnosed with
prediabetes it came as quite a shock. Now she wants to make sure others
understand why the stereotypes around type 2 are unhelpful, and untrue.
>>>>>>> Michelle Griffith-Robinson OLY shares experiences aboutJourney with
>>>>>>> My mum, Cicely, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when she was 58. It
wasn’t a shock at the time. My grandmother had died of renal failure relating
to complications of type 2 diabetes in the 70s in Jamaica, and my mum’s
sisters and some of my cousins have it.
>>>>>>> Mum has always been active, but I would say lifestyle and genetics
would have played their part. I wasn’t surprised because of her diet, our
family history, and everything else. If I’m being really honest, I didn’t
>>>>>>> My brother’s best friend has type 1 diabetes. I’d grown up with that,
so that was the only type of diabetes I knew about.
>>>>>>> I’ve noticed that if people have type 2 diabetes, in the black
community, we don’t really speak about it that much.

>>>>>>> I’ve noticed that if people have type 2 diabetes, in the black
community, we don’t really speak about it that much.
>>>>>>> When I was 12 years old, my mum had a keep fit class at our local
sports ground and I went along with her. I was bored, so I joined in with some
people at running track. That was the start of my long love affair with track
>>>>>>> I was very fast, always the best at school, always would beat the
boys, and I recognised then that I had a big ability and a big talent. When my
school recognised I had an ability, I was encouraged a lot, particularly by
>>>>>>> I loved it. I loved the training vibe, the fact that there were
different communities, diversities. It didn’t matter what your background was.
All that was important was being at the track with people around you with a
>>>>>>> My greatest achievement was walking out, wearing my team GB tracksuit,
into the 1996 Olympic Games. I also represented Great Britain in the 1998
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur and in the 2006 Commonwealth Games in
>>>>>>> I was the first woman to jump over 14m in the Commonwealth. That was a
big achievement. Breaking milestones made me want to encourage and inspire
others that they could also do great things.
>>>>>>> When you compete at that level, it takes over everything. But I am
such a big advocate of sport because of the benefits. They are huge. Sport has
equipped me with so many life skills. You learn emotional intelligence, you
know when you have to work hard. I use sport as a vehicle, to allow me to
branch out to different things. It’s afforded me so much.
>>>>>>> I don’t care if my three children don’t do sport to a competitive
level. But what I would like to see is that everyone is able to participate in
sport – at any level. It’s down to schools to encourage that, because you
don’t know what hidden talents are out there.
>>>>>>> After I retired, I did take my foot off the gas in terms of training.
I started living a much more relaxed life. I set different goals for myself.
So, I did some half marathons, kickboxing, weight training. I’ve always loved
>>>>>>> My greatest achievement was walking out, wearing my team GB tracksuit,
>>>>>>> ###My diagnosis came as quite a shock
>>>>>>> In 2018, I noticed I was weeing a lot. Leading up to that, I had a bit
of numbness in my leg – I don’t know if that was related or not.
>>>>>>> I did a bit of Googling and my biggest fear was that I maybe had
>>>>>>> When I went to my doctor they did a test and told me I was prediabetic
– where your blood sugar levels are higher than usual, but not high enough to
be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I thought, ‘I’ll take that in a heartbeat
over bladder cancer. I can do something about that.’
>>>>>>> But I was also like, ‘me? Really?!’
>>>>>>> There’s a lot of stereotyping around type 2. People think, ‘oh she
>>>>>>> I suppose I was guilty of that myself. People think, ‘oh, she’s
athletic, she can’t have type 2!’ But there are many genetic and lifestyle
>>>>>>> My brush with diabetes made me realise that, in the black community,
we don’t really speak about type 2 diabetes that much, despite the fact that
>>>>>>> Now, I want to really educate black people. It’s not a crime that
you’ve got type 2 diabetes, but what can you do about it? And how can we
prevent our sisters, nephews, nieces, cousins, from getting it? We don’t talk
about these things enough, and that’s part of the problem. We need to talk
>>>>>>> I want to show women, particularly black women, that it’s time to get
out there, try new things and make ourselves more visible.
>>>>>>> At the same time, we don’t need to be doing everything to Olympic
>>>>>>> The diagnosis properly fired me up. I was really bloody minded about
it all. I didn’t want to be on tablets and decided I’d do anything to avoid
that. I was offered a place in a class to help with my food and nutrition. I
said I appreciated that it’s probably very good and helpful for most people,
but I’ve had years of sports nutritionists telling me what to eat. I knew what
I had to do – partly eat fewer starchy carbs, but mainly I had to cut down my
>>>>>>> I’ve become very creative in the kitchen. My husband came on board,
which made all the difference. When you’re facing something like diabetes,
it’s important to have a good support system.
>>>>>>> You have to be realistic, too. Life is for living, so I’m a huge
advocate of adopting a lifestyle that you can sustain.
>>>>>>> Life is for living, so I’m a huge advocate of adopting a lifestyle
>>>>>>> ###Inspiring women and girls to make changes
>>>>>>> I wanted to get in touch with Diabetes UK because of my family’s
experiences with diabetes. I’m a life coach, I do motivational speaking, I
talk about why we need to have more women and girls on boards, to make
changes. I thought, ‘here’s something that’s so close to my heart. It’s a
>>>>>>> I want to inspire people to take small steps to improve their health.
To make a conscious decision today. Change your breakfast, cut your portion by
25%. Cut the sugar in your tea down gradually, until you’re taking none.
>>>>>>> On top of that, I want to show women, particularly black women, that
it’s time to kick arse and get on it. We need more women like me, of colour,
saying, ‘let’s climb Mount Everest. Let’s go zipwiring. Let’s not limit
>>>>>>> At the same time, we don’t need to be doing things to Olympic level.
But we need to be able to say, ‘I’ve tried that.’
>>>>>>> I want to get the message out to the Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic
community that ‘if it can happen to me, it can happen to you. Let’s make
