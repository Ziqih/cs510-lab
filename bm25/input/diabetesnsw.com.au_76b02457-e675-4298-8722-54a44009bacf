1. Dry roast semolina in a pan (with no oil) over medium heat, until light brown. Transfer to a plate to completely cool. Set aside 2-3 tablespoons.
2. Peel and grate the beetroot and set aside in a bowl. Grate the carrots separately.
3. Finely chop the kale. Chop the garlic cloves and onion.
4. Boil 1 cup of water in a pan. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting, and add the semolina (leaving aside 2-3 tablespoons) and stir to prevent lumps forming. Switch off the heat and cool completely.
5. Heat a teaspoon of olive oil and saute onion and garlic on a medium – low heat. Add carrots and beetroot into the pan cooking until soft, followed by the kale. Cook for a few minutes, then switch off the heat, and work in the left over semolina, salt and pepper and mix well. Set aside to cool.
6. Using ½ cup of mixture, the kids can help you form 6 burger patties, and coat with the leftover roasted semolina.
7. Add 2 tsp of olive oil into a pan, and cook the burgers for 5-10 mins on each side. In the last few minutes of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top of each pattie to melt. Place patties onto a plate to cool before serving with your favourite toppings!
* You can always add other veggies to your patties or substitute with other vegetables such as zucchini, leek, eggplant, mushrooms and cauliflower
* Load your buns up with salad vegetables - lettuce, tomatoes, more grated beetroot and carrot
* For a healthful topping why not use a small amount of tzatziki: Greek yoghurt + finely chopped cucumber + squeeze or two of lemon juice + touch of chopped mint, dill, chives and garlic to taste
