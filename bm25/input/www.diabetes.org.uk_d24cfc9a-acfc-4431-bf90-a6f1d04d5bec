* How to talk to your employer about your risk 
* What to do if your workplace isn’t Covid-19 secure
* Time off work for illness and check-ups
* Applying for a job with diabetes 
People living with diabetes are classed by the government as being clinically
vulnerable. This means you have a moderate risk of becoming seriously ill if
you get coronavirus and employers need to take all reasonable steps to make
There are differences in guidance for employers and employees depending on
where you live. Here are some useful links to keep you up to date:
In England, the government guidance that previously said that employees who
are clinically vulnerable should work at home where possible was lifted on 1st
August. The latest guidance no longer specifically addresses clinically
vulnerable workers. However, it does say that employers must take account of
the fact they are vulnerable when considering their work. But there is more
specific advice for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable.
In Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales the advice is still to work at home
where possible. If you're unable to work from home, you should be offered the
option of the safest available on-site roles. Everyone should be able to stay
The UK Government has guidance for employers on what they need to do to help
you work safely, including doing a risk assessment. If you have diabetes and
are working at this time, you have the right to ask for reasonable adjustments

One in six working people with diabetes feel they’ve been discriminated
against by their employer because of their diabetes. If you feel you’ve been
mistreated, remember you have rights. During the pandemic, your rights include

As someone living with diabetes in England, Scotland or Wales, your rights at
work are set out in the Equality Act 2010. If you live in Northern Ireland,
they are in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.
Both these acts state the steps employers must follow in their treatment of
employees and job seekers who have a disability. While you might not think of
your diabetes as a disability, you should be protected by these acts.
The Equality Act 2010 describes a disability as a physical or mental
impairment that has a large long-term negative effect on a person’s ability to
carry out normal day-to-day activities. If you take medication, the decision
is based on how your impairment would affect you if you didn’t take the
medication. So, to ask whether diabetes fits the description of disability,
you must consider the effect of diabetes if it wasn’t being treated.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has guidance for employers and
workers on the Equality Act which gives information on what the law means in
practice and includes practical examples. For a more detailed description of
the legislation and to see the Act itself, go to the Equality and Human Rights
Commission. The Equality Advisory Support Service can also provide further

If your workplace has over five employees, you have a right to a risk
assessment for coronavirus (as you would for other health and safety hazards).
This could help you and your employer to find out what reasonable adjustments
A Public Health England report titled 'Disparities in the risk and outcomes of
COVID-19' (PDF, 2.9MB) found that people with diabetes are at an increased
risk of poor outcomes if they catch the virus, and this must be considered in
As part of this assessment process, employers have a duty to consult their
staff and should share the final assessment with you.
You can request that your employer involve occupational health in this
process. This will mean that a professional, with an understanding of your
condition, can help you and your employer understand what can be done to keep
There are several risk assessment tools that might be used to look at your
individual risk, but we do not recommend any tool in particular. This is
because they generally do not consider the different factors that make up the
risk for people with diabetes or calculate the risk of having more than one
If you're not sure what to say to your employer when asking for a risk
assessment, you can use our template letter (Word, 23KB).

Disability law is about making everything fairer by making sure people with a
disability have the same chance at a career as others. This means your
employer may need to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ so you can do your job.
For example, if you have diabetes and need to eat at set times to stay on top
of your blood sugar levels, having your lunch break swapped around every day
on a rota could make this difficult. A reasonable adjustment could be for your
employer to allow you to have your lunch break at the same time every day.
During the pandemic, you may want to discuss changing your hours slightly so
you can avoid the busiest times on public transport.
Where you can’t be 2 metres apart while at work, employers should do
everything practical to manage the risk of spreading the virus. This might
mean working back-to-back or with plastic screens for instance. If this isn't
possible, employers have to carefully assess whether this is an acceptable
You can get advice on reasonable adjustments from the Disability Employment
Adviser (DEA) at your local Jobcentre Plus office, or the Disability
Access to Work is a government programme to help keep people with long-term
conditions and disabilities in work. You should speak to them if your employer
can’t or isn’t willing to make reasonable adjustments so that you can carry on

## Having conversations with your employer about your risk
The government classifies people with diabetes as ‘clinically vulnerable’.
This means that there is an increased risk of severe illness if you catch
coronavirus. But not everyone’s level of risk is the same.
In May, NHS England published a review which showed that for younger people
with diabetes under the age of 50, the risk of becoming seriously ill was not
necessarily higher than for people without diabetes. Your risk can also vary
depending on your overall health, ethnicity and other factors. Read more about
If you feel that you are at higher risk you should talk to your employer about
why and how to make the workplace safer for you or if changes can be made to
make the environment safer, such as undertaking a different role or working at
If your employer is asking you to complete your own risk assessment and you’re
not sure what you should be asking for, contact our helpline.
If your area is under a local lockdown or other restrictions, you and your
employer should look at specific guidance. This will be available from your

We’ve also come up with a checklist below to support this conversation. Not
everything may apply to you personally, but it should help guide you on what
* Have you asked your employer about doing a risk assessment of the workplace? 
* Have you seen the risk assessment? 
* Have you been involved in the risk assessment process? 
* If you feel you’re at higher risk, have you asked whether occupational health can be involved in an individual risk assessment? 
* Have you discussed if you can continue working from home with your employer? 
* Have you discussed any issues relating to your journey to work with your employer? Could you ask your employer about altering your hours to avoid having to travel during the busiest times? 
* Has your employer made reasonable changes to your workplace to enable you to work as safely as possible, such as social distancing, plastic screens and extra cleaning? 
* Have you been given access to any personal protective equipment (PPE) you might need to do your job safely? 
* If your area is subject to a ‘local lockdown’ has your employer said what they would expect you to do? 
### What if I don’t want to tell my employer I have diabetes?
If you feel unable to tell your employer you have diabetes, you may wish to
seek a fit note from your GP. This may simply be a recommendation that you
work from home or in a different role given the functional impact of your
condition. Ideally it should also state that this condition has lasted or will
last for more than 12 months so it is clear that your condition is classed as
a disability under the Equality Act 2010 (EA 2010).
Your employer should meet the recommendations of a registered medical
professional. However, ideally the letter would mention your condition to make
sure you benefit from protection under EA 2010.
## What to do if your workplace isn’t Covid-19 secure
If you’re concerned that your place of work is not Covid-19 secure, for
example, if you feel unsafe about not being able to socially distance or you
are without adequate protections, there are things that you can do.
You should firstly ask to see what risk assessment your employer has done.
However, if this is not provided by your employer, or the risk assessment
doesn’t address your concerns, you may want to talk to a union or staff
If you have raised concerns about your safety with your employer but don’t
feel they have been addressed, you can contact the Health and Safety
Executive. They are the government body responsible for safety at work. If you
have a trade union, you can also contact them. And remember, you can call our
If your employer is refusing to make adjustments for you to take account of
your diabetes, you may be being discriminated against. If you think you’ve
been discriminated against, contact our helpline and we will advise on where

### Get a letter of support directly from us
We can provide you with a letter of support from us, explaining to your
employer that diabetes is a ‘clinically vulnerable’ condition. This will help
to explain to your employer that they must keep your diabetes at the centre of
any decisions about going back to your workplace.
If you think this would help your employer to understand how best to support
By sharing this information with your employer with a letter of support, we
hope to remind them of their responsibilities to you as an employee. Although
we cannot include personal information about you or your diabetes, we will be
able to explain why it is so important for your employer to take steps to keep
Like anyone, your stress levels are likely to be higher when working, which
can make managing your diabetes more difficult. This is even more important
during the pandemic, especially if your work and home are the same right now.
Make sure you take time out to relax throughout the day. And talk to your
manager about flexible working options, which can make it easier to manage
The better your colleagues understand your diabetes, the easier it will be to
get the support you need. A good first step can be to share our information on
Diabetes: the basics and let them know about our guide for employers
Encourage your colleagues to ask you questions and give them the information
they need to help. Reassure them that you’re in control of your condition and
If you didn’t talk about your diabetes when you applied for the job, it’s a
good idea to tell your line manager about it sooner rather than later. They’ve
already decided you’re the best person for the job and will want you to be the
best you can be at work. And if they don’t know about your diabetes, they may
not be able to give you the support you need.
You can also download our Guide for people with diabetes at work (PDF, 1MB).
While working, it’s more important than ever to be organised to manage your
diabetes safely. Put reminders for blood sugar tests and injections in your
calendar. Look at what meetings you have at the start of the day so you can

these are things you need to do to keep safe. You shouldn’t feel embarrassed
about it. Explain to your colleagues what you’re doing and don’t feel the need
If you’re at risk of hypos, tell your colleagues how to spot the symptoms and
how to treat one. This will make sure you get the right help and stop them

## Time off work for illness and check-ups
Everybody needs time off work when they’re unwell or have a medical
appointment – whether they have diabetes or not. Diabetes doesn’t mean you’re
more likely to be ill, and this includes being no more likely to catch
coronavirus than anyone else. You’re probably taking better care of your
You’ll need regular check-ups as part of your 15 Healthcare Essentials. Make
sure your line manager understands why these checks are necessary – don’t
It’s important to read your organisation’s policy on time off for medical
appointments and managing long-term conditions, because the rules vary between
workplaces. Try to arrange multiple appointments in the same morning or
afternoon if you can and give your manager plenty of notice.
Always seek medical attention when you’re ill. Don’t wait until it’s urgent.
And keep your employer up to date with what’s happening so that they can
You may need time off to support someone with diabetes. Find out your
employer’s policy on care leave. Talk to your manager about the condition and
how you’re helping, so they understand how important it is.
Discuss options for flexible working if you need to give long-term support.
And remember to look after your own emotional wellbeing – is there an employee
assistance programme or in-house counsellor you can talk to?
> “I work for a council and was penalised for taking time off for appointments
> that I had no control over the timing of. I got in touch with HR and now I
> can attend appointments without losing out financially.”
## Time off work for a diabetes education course
Going on a virtual diabetes education course may mean time off work.
Explain to your line manager that the course will help you manage your
diabetes and mean you’re less likely to need time off in future. And you’ll
have a lower risk of developing diabetes related complications that could
affect your work. Some course providers, like DAFNE, have materials you can
pass on to your employer that explain the benefits.
Use our template letter to put your leave request in writing. You can ask a
member of your healthcare team to write to your employer explaining why the
course is important and how it can improve your health in the long term. You
may have the right to go on a course under the Equality Act.
If taking time off isn’t possible, or classroom-based learning isn’t right for
you, check with your healthcare team about evening, weekend or digital
courses. You can also sign up to our Learning Zone for free educational
When you apply for a new job, your potential employer will want to find out if
you fit the person specification and have the necessary skills and experience
for the role. If you meet the needs of the job description, you should feel
confident. Having diabetes doesn’t mean you’re less likely to get the job.
For most jobs, there’s no legal obligation to tell an employer you have
diabetes. The Equality Act makes it unlawful for them to ask about your health
But talking about your diabetes from the start can show that you’re positive
about your condition. It can even be an opportunity to give examples of how
In some cases, the organisation may ask if you have a disability. For example:
* to find out if you need any support during the recruitment process,
* to increase the representation of disabled people in the organisation,
* if they have signed up to the 'Disability Confident' scheme, committing to offer disabled people an interview if they meet the minimum criteria for the role,
* or to monitor how many disabled people apply for jobs.
Telling them about your diabetes shouldn’t affect your application. Any
information you give them must be kept separate and confidential.
Some professions do have special requirements because of the demands of the
role. The employer will need to decide whether your diabetes poses any
additional risk at work. If your condition could stop you carrying out your
responsibilities or make you unsafe, think about reasonable adjustments that
would make it possible for you to do the job.
If you are applying for a job that involves driving, we have information on
how to apply for a licence for different vehicles.
## Employers that don’t allow people with diabetes
We’ve campaigned successfully to stop employers banning people with diabetes
from applying for roles. But we still have work to do.
* Emergency services. Blanket bans have now been lifted for people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes using insulin. It’s now up to your local service to decide – they will have their own rules. For example, some NHS Ambulance Trusts have rules about people with diabetes applying for jobs as ambulance crew. You should expect to be fairly assessed against these rules by someone who understands the role and how diabetes is managed.
* The UK armed forces are exempt from the Equality Act and have a blanket ban on employing people with diabetes.
Get the latest government advice for self-employed people during the pandemic.
Self-employment can seem like the easier option when you have diabetes. But
you shouldn’t feel like it’s your only choice. Weigh up your options carefully
and decide what will work best for you.
Being self-employed gives you more flexibility to attend appointments. And
working from home means you can treat your diabetes more easily in privacy, if
you prefer this. But self-employed people don’t get sick or holiday pay. And
working alone can mean you lack the support of colleagues and the social
