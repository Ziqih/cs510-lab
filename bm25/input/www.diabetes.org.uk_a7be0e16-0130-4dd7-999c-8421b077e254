### HbA1c is your average blood glucose (sugar) levels for the last two to
three months. If you have diabetes, an ideal HbA1c level is 48mmol/mol (6.5%)
If you're at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, your target HbA1c level
On this page we’ll go through what HbA1c means, and why aiming for your target
level is so important. We’ll also explain the HbA1c test in more detail, and
show you what you can do to lower your HbA1c levels if they’re too high. Plus,
you can use our HbA1c converter tool if you’re looking to find out your level
HbA1c is what’s known as glycated haemoglobin. This is something that’s made
when the glucose (sugar) in your body sticks to your red blood cells. Your
body can’t use the sugar properly, so more of it sticks to your blood cells
and builds up in your blood. Red blood cells are active for around 2-3 months,
which is why the reading is taken quarterly.
A high HbA1c means you have too much sugar in your blood. This means you’re
more likely to develop diabetes complications, like serious problems with your
Knowing your HbA1c level and what you can do to lower it will help you reduce
your risk of devastating complications. This means getting your HbA1c checked
regularly. It’s a vital check and part of your annual review. You’re entitled
to get this test at least once a year. But if your HbA1c is high or needs a
little more attention, it’ll be done every three to six months. It's really
important not to skip these tests, so if you haven't had one in over a year
Once you know your HbA1c level, it’s important that you understand what the
results mean and how to stop them from getting too high. Even a slightly
raised HbA1c level makes you more at risk of serious complications, so get all
the facts here and be in the know about HbA1c.
You can check these average blood sugar levels yourself, but you’ll have to
buy a kit, whereas your healthcare professional will do it for free. It’s
different from a finger-prick test, which is a snapshot of your blood sugar
levels at a particular time, on a particular day.
You find out your HbA1c level by getting a blood test by a doctor or nurse.
Your healthcare team will arrange this for you, but chase it up with your GP
if you haven’t had one for a few months.
Most people will have the test every three to six months. But you may need it
more often if you’re planning for a baby, your treatment has recently changed,
or you’re having problems managing your blood sugar levels.
And some people will need the test less often, usually later on during
pregnancy. Or need a different test altogether, like with some types of
anaemia. A fructosamine test can be used instead, but it’s very rare.
An HbA1c test is also used to diagnose diabetes, and to keep an eye on your
levels if you’re at risk of developing diabetes (you have prediabetes).
The test is sometimes called haemoglobin A1c or just A1c.
You should get the results quickly. The result of the HbA1c test lets your
healthcare team know if they need to change your treatment or medication to
help you manage your levels better. But it also tells you a number and it’s
important you understand what this means. Some people find it helps to write
their results down in a diary, to keep track of them and see if they can spot
And your HbA1c can change for lots of reasons, including:
* if you’re taking other medicines, like steroids
* if you’re feeling very stressed or you’re depressed.
You’ll talk to your healthcare team about a target level that you need to aim
for. We know this isn’t as easy as it sounds, but it’s important you do
everything you can to keep in your target range. The longer your HbA1c level
is even slightly high, the more you’re at risk of developing life-threatening
We have lots of information and tools to help you lower your HbA1c.
> If you have diabetes, an ideal HbA1c level is 48mmol/mol (6.5%) or below.
But everyone’s different. So your healthcare team may give you an individual
target level that takes into account your current level and when your next
test is. So you can bring it down in stages and isn’t a sudden big drop.
And we’re not saying it’s easy to get to and stay at this level. We know it’s
difficult, and we’re here to give you advice and information to help.
### If you're at risk of type 2 diabetes
There are different target HbA1c levels for people at risk of developing type
2 diabetes. If you’ve been told you’re at risk, your target level should be
below 42mmol/mol (6%). We have lots more information for you if you’re at risk
Remission is when a person with type 2 diabetes has healthy blood glucose
(also called sugar) levels for the long-term, without taking any diabetes
medications. We’re working with international experts to agree this, but our
researchers used an HbA1c level of 48mmol/mol (6.5%) or less to define
Type 2 diabetes is still a serious condition. It can be lifelong and get worse
over time for many, but it doesn’t have to be like this for everyone. This can
be life-changing. Find out more about type 2 diabetes remission.
If you’re wondering how to convert HbA1c mmol/mol to %, or vice versa, our
Mmol/mol stands for millimoles per mole. A mole is a scientific unit often
used to measure chemicals, and it has been the standard measurement for
glucose levels since 2009. Before that, a percentage was used. That’s why

If your levels have gone above your target since your last check, it’s
understandable to be worried. Even a slightly high HbA1c level puts you more
at risk of developing serious complications in your body. But knowing your
numbers and what that means is an important and good first step – now you need
Lots of things can cause your HbA1c levels to change and there’s action you
and your healthcare team can take to bring them down to your target level:
* Your diabetes team may need to review your medication and increase the dose or try a new one.
* Ask them about local diabetes education courses – there's always more to learn with diabetes and a course will help you take practical steps to lower your HbA1c.
* Get more active – moving more is good for everyone, but it can specifically help to bring down your HbA1c levels.
* Stop smoking – smoking makes it harder for blood to flow around your body.
