# Research suggests there could be different forms of Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes could be broken down into different subtypes, according to
research published today in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology.
Scientists in Sweden and Finland have found that Type 2 diabetes could be
separated out into four subtypes, which have distinct characteristics. This
suggests that people with Type 2 diabetes might be affected by their diabetes
in different ways and benefit from different treatments.
Go to the research in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology.
The researchers studied nearly 15,000 people with diabetes across Sweden and
Finland. They examined factors like body mass index, blood glucose control and
how well insulin-producing cells in the pancreas were working. Of the four
types, they found the more common two were linked to older age or being
overweight. The other two less common types were linked to a higher risk of
### A new way of thinking about Type 2?
At the moment, we think of Type 2 diabetes as one condition. But this research
highlights the fact that there are likely to be differences within this.
With almost 3.7 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK, of which
around 90 per cent have Type 2, it’s unlikely that everyone has exactly the
Moving away from one-size-fits all to a more personalised approach could mean
better care for people with Type 2 diabetes. From a more precise diagnosis,
through to tailored treatments to manage blood glucose levels and reduce the
risk of diabetes-related complications. For example, some might benefit from
starting insulin therapy earlier after diagnosis, or perhaps being monitored
This study is the first step in helping us understand the breakdown of Type 2
diabetes. But there’s still a lot to discover about potential subtypes before
we get to the point where we can tailor individual treatments.

Scientists across the world are also looking at whether subtypes of Type 1
diabetes could exist. For example, research suggests that some people have a
form of Type 1 diabetes that progresses much faster, or more slowly, than
others. So we hope to move toward personalised medicines for both Type 1 and
