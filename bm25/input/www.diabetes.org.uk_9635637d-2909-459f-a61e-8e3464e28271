>>>>>>> Sleep disturbance: new insights into the clinical impact in diabetes
>>>>>>> Dr Martin Rutter plans to work out if sleep problems can help to
predict who’s at risk of Type 2 diabetes. He’ll also look at whether sleep
patterns in people with Type 2 diabetes can affect their blood glucose control
and risk of complications. This research could help to prevent some people
developing Type 2 diabetes and improve the health of people living with the
>>>>>>> We all have a ‘biological clock’ which controls our sleep patterns and
how our body uses glucose. Modern life can disturb this clock, resulting in
too little sleep, broken sleep or sleeping at the wrong times.
>>>>>>> Earlier research has suggested that people with these kind of sleep
problems may have a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes. Some studies have also
shown that disrupted sleep could raise blood glucose levels.
>>>>>>> Dr Rutter will look at data about sleep disturbances from the UK
Biobank: one of the largest health studies in the world, co-funded by us. It
collects biological samples (like blood and saliva) and other measurements
(including weight, blood pressure and sleep) from over 500,000 volunteers in
the UK in order to follow their health.
>>>>>>> 100,000 of these people have worn an activity monitor, which gives
more detailed picture of sleep disturbances and patterns. Dr Rutter’s team
will also look at information collected on genes, blood glucose control and
who went on to develop Type 2 diabetes. Using all of this information
together, they want to find out if measuring sleep disturbance can help us
predict who’ll get Type 2 diabetes in the future.
>>>>>>> Dr Rutter will then study people with Type 2 diabetes, to see if sleep
disturbance affects their blood glucose control and increases their risk of
>>>>>>> ### Potential benefit to people with diabetes
>>>>>>> This research **** could help us to better identify those at high risk
of Type 2 diabetes, **** so people can be supported to lower their risk. If
this study shows that blood glucose control and complications are affected by
sleep, this could potentially open up a new way to help people with Type 2
diabetes manage their condition and reduce their risk of complications.
