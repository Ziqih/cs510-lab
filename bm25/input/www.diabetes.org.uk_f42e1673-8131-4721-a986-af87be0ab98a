Insulin is a hormone that’s made by the pancreas, which is an organ that helps
with digestion. But in children with Type 1 diabetes, the body has stopped
producing it. That’s why children with Type 1 diabetes need to take insulin,
whether that’s through injections or an insulin pump.
On this page we will take you through how to give your child insulin
injections, as well as giving them the information they’ll need to start
Marley started injecting himself with insulin when he felt confident. Along
with mum Lauren, watch him show you how it’s done.
There’s no right age for your child to start doing their own injections. Some
children prefer to do it themselves straight away. Others may want to get used
to having injections given to them by an adult, before learning to inject
Your child needs to make the decision in their own time. When they’re ready,
you can help them take on the responsibility themselves.
When they say they’re ready, try to encourage them. You can show them how it’s
done using our video, or by reading through these simple instructions with

You’ll usually inject insulin four (or more) times a day with an insulin pen.
Your child will probably find the first few injections a bit uncomfortable or
painful, as you’ll both be tense and anxious, but as their confidence grows,

## How to help your child inject insulin
The most important thing is to be as supportive as possible. Here are some
* Don’t pressure your child to do their own injections – wait until they’re ready.
* Don’t do the injections yourself if they want to take responsibility. Encourage them to take control of their diabetes.
* Remember that even when your child does their own injections, they may not want to do them all the time. Offer to do their injections yourself if they want you to.
* Keep an eye on their technique, just in case they get into bad habits. 
Make sure they don’t inject into a site that they’ll use straight away for an
activity. For example, don’t inject your child’s leg just before they play
football. This makes the insulin act quicker and so a hypo more likely.
Some children and teenagers use an insulin pump rather than an insulin pen.
The pump gives doses of rapid-acting insulin throughout the day and night. You
can also change the dose to provide more insulin if they have something to eat
or if their blood sugar level rises too high.
If your child would like to use a pump, ask a healthcare professional. There
are guidelines about who can use one, and they will be able to tell you. Some
children prefer to inject, as pumps can feel like a burden because it’s

diabetes team will show you how. Some insulin pens give half units of insulin,
which can be helpful when injecting a baby-sized dose. Or your baby may be
If it’s difficult to hold your baby still, hold them securely over your knee
and inject into their bottom. Remember that it’s important to change injection
sites, even if you find injecting into one place easier than another.
