* Type 2 diabetes and me – online course
DiaBuddies Days is one of our most loved programs. As we work on how we safely
return to face to face events, we are excited to announce we will be trialling
online DiaBuddies sessions that will run throughout the rest of 2020.
At present, we are offering families a series of four sessions spread over
three weeks. These sessions will be for the whole family, with a focus on
parents and carers in session one, and children for the other three sessions.
We’ll be looking at what does and doesn’t work online to make these events as
good as possible, and will keep changing and improving them as we go.
In our parents and carers session we’ll cover experiences of coping with the
new ‘normal’ that type 1 diabetes brings. As well as talking about diabetes in
the school environment, strategies for communicating with health professionals
and further places for support. The children’s sessions will use games and
practical activities to help them understand the links between their diabetes,
food and physical activity, whilst meeting other children with type 1
Families will have an opportunity to connect with each other through the
activities, as well as share their tips and advice. There will be short
sessions with our resident health professionals, Q&A’s, games and other
activities that you can do from your living room.
As part of this work we are also setting up an online community for parents
and carers of children with type 1 diabetes, to stay in touch and support each
other. Keep an eye on your email inbox and our social media channels for more
