New research released today has found that increased sugary drink consumption
can increase risk of type 2 diabetes independent of weight gain or obesity.

weight gain that then led to type 2 diabetes. But an Australian National
University led study of 40,000 adults showed the more sugary drinks consumed,
the higher the risk of type 2 diabetes independent of weight gain and obesity.
Lead author Keren Papier from ANU said type 2 diabetes killed millions of
people globally every year and evidence from around the world showed that a
reduction in sugary drink consumption would reduce rates of type 2 diabetes.

impact on the health of Australian children and young people where there is
very high consumption of sugary drinks with no nutritional benefit.

“Over 25 years a tax on sugary drinks could mean 16,000 fewer cases of type 2
diabetes, 4,400 fewer cases of heart disease and 1,100 fewer cases of stroke.
“Anything that makes sugary drinks a less appealing product and encourages
Australians to consume less of them, and more of healthy alternatives like
