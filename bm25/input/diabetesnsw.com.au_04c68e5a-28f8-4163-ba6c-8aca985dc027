Misinformation has been causing unnecessary confusion and fear during this
period of COVID-19. With many restaurants now offering food deliveries and
takeaway meals, you asked us whether it’s safe to have takeaway food delivered
or if COVID-19 can be contracted from packaging and foods.
In case you haven’t yet already heard enough about it, COVID-19 is a
respiratory illness caused by a new virus called SARS-CoV-2 (part of the
Coronavirus family). Like many other respiratory viruses, we know SARS-CoV-2
infects the cells of our airways, causing a range of symptoms, or none at all.
It can spread easily from person-to-person and can be coughed into the air and
onto surfaces. An individual can then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects
or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
As COVID-19 continues its rapid spread in Australia, we have been advised to
practice safe social distancing, to stay indoors as much as possible and
minimise human contact. Sadly, this means no outings to your favourite
restaurant. One of the biggest challenges this creates is getting food if you
don’t feel like cooking. In light of this, many restaurants now offer food
deliveries and pre-prepared meals. However, the rise of these options has led
many to consider whether COVID-19 can be contracted from packaging and foods.
According to Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), there are little
evidence to support that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food or food
packaging. So far, there is no evidence that people have become infected by
swallowing the virus in or on food or drink. The Europe Food Safety Authority
(EFSA) has released a statement to say that “food is not likely source or
route of transmission of the virus”. Even if the virus did survive on your
food, it will be likely to end up in your stomach. Tthe low pH in your stomach
Research has found the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that gives you COVID-19 the
respiratory illness, may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several
days. This may vary under different conditions, such as type of surface,
temperature or humidity of the environment. Hard, shiny surfaces, such as
benchtops, plastic and stainless steel tends to encourage the virus to stay
active for longer. Porous surfaces such as cardboard or paper are less likely
Takeaway (healthy choices, of course!) supports local businesses and takes the
stress off you having to cook all the time. While there is little evidence to
support the notion that COVID-19 can be transmitted through packaging, coming
into contact with any surface carrying the virus can still pose risk. Getting
takeaway might not be completely risk-free, however, this risk can be reduced
##** _Some things to consider when purchasing delivered foods:_**
* Ask for contactless delivery – the biggest risk of infection comes through person-to-person contact. Thankfully many delivery services are now providing contactless services, such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo. However, if you are ordering directly from a restaurant, make sure they know to avoid contact by simply asking the courier to leave the meal at the doorstep.
* Always put the delivery bag in the sink rather than on the kitchen counter or table.
* Transfer the takeaway food to a plate, throw away the packaging your delivery comes in as soon as you can and sanitise the sink.
* Wash hands before sitting down to eat – this is particularly important. After you have disposed of the packaging and before you eat, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with warm soapy water.
* Use your own cutlery rather than that provided by the restaurant.
There is little evidence to support that COVID-19 can be transmitted through
food or food packaging. But there is no harm in taking extra precautions.
