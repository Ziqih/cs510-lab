A special supplement about to be published in the Journal of the Endocrine
Society, reports that a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) called machine
learning may help predict who will develop diabetes.
Diabetes is linked to the increased risks of complications such as heart and
kidney damage, vision loss and amputation. So preventing diabetes can help
reduce the impact of severe illness and death.
Lead author of the study Akihiro Nomura, said "We currently don’t have
sufficient methods for predicting which generally healthy individuals will
The researchers investigated how machine learning could help with the
Machine learning enables computers to learn without being explicitly
programmed. With each exposure to new data, a machine-learning algorithm grows
“Using machine learning, it may be possible to identify people at high risk of
developing diabetes with more accuracy than current risk scores or
calculators. In addition, analysing visits to healthcare providers might help
predict the future onset of diabetes and improve prevention," said Dr Nomura.
Nomura and his colleagues analysed over half a million Japanese national
annual health records from 139,225 participants over a period of ten years.
This included 65,505 participants who did not have diabetes.
The data included physical exams, blood and urine tests and participant
questionnaires. People without diabetes at the beginning of the study who
underwent more than two annual health check-ups during this period were
included. New cases of diabetes were recorded during patients' check-ups.
The researchers identified a total of 4,696 new diabetes patients (7.2%) in
the study period. Their trained computer model predicted the future incidence
of diabetes with an overall accuracy of 94.9%.
The phase of the study is to perform clinical trials to assess the
effectiveness of preventative treatments on those identified by the machine
learning model as being at high risk of developing diabetes.
