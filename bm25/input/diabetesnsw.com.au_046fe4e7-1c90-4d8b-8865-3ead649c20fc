losing weight has a series of significant health benefits.
Researchers found that losing 13 percent of your body weight cuts the chance
of developing type 2 diabetes by 42 per cent.
It also reduces the chance of going on to develop high blood pressure or sleep
apnoea, where your breathing stops and starts as you sleep, by one quarter.
People who lost weight also reduced their risk of getting hip and knee
The huge benefits were seen even when people remained obese, with a body mass
The study, presented at the European and International Congress on Obesity,
was based on GP surgery data for 550,000 UK adults with an average age of 51
