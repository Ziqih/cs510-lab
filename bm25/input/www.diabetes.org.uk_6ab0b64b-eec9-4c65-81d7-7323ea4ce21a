>>>>>>> Harnessing genetic information in the SDRNT1BIO to understand Type 1
>>>>>>> Professor Helen Colhoun and her team will look for specific genes
involved in Type 1 diabetes and its complications, to provide insight into the
complex pathways involved. This will help to develop new therapies for Type 1
>>>>>>> No cure or means of preventing Type 1 diabetes or its complications,
such as kidney disease, has yet been found. More than 50 locations within our
genes have been identified as influencing the risk of developing Type 1
diabetes. These genetic discoveries have identified many potential biological
pathways involved, some of which are now being targeted by new therapies.
>>>>>>> However, these gene locations don't explain everything, and new
locations continue to be discovered. Almost all studies to date have been in
groups of individuals with childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes, despite the fact
that almost 50 percent of Type 1 diabetes arises in adulthood. This means that
additional work to detect new gene locations is necessary, especially for
those who develop Type 1 diabetes at an older age.
>>>>>>> Complications of Type 1 diabetes, for example damage to the eye and
kidney disease, are also partly determined by our genes. But, so far, studies
which have attempted to discover the genes involved haven't been successful.
>>>>>>> With previous support from us and the Chief Scientist Office in
Scotland, Professor Helen Colhoun enrolled 6,152 people with Type 1 diabetes,
stored their biological samples, and linked their data to their electronic
health care records (called The Scottish Diabetes Research Network Type 1
>>>>>>> With our new funding, Professor Colhoun and her team will analyse this
data and attempt to discover new genes associated with Type 1 diabetes,
including adult-onset Type 1 diabetes, and its complications. The team will
also investigate how the genes associated with Type 1 diabetes and its
complications influence the risk of developing Type 1 diabetes.
>>>>>>> ### Potential benefit to people with diabetes
>>>>>>> People with Type 1 diabetes need effective treatments to slow or
prevent the development of the condition and its complications. The
researchers hope to discover the biological pathways involved in Type 1
diabetes and its complications, so that treatments that interfere with these

of developing Type 1 diabetes, so that they can be invited to take part in
