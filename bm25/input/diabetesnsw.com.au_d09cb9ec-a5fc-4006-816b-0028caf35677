# Frequent exercise breaks good for type 2 diabetes
A new study has found that frequent exercise breaks during prolonged sitting
may be better for blood vessel health in people with type 2 diabetes than
The research was conducted by Australian Catholic University.
People living with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of heart disease and
reduced vascular or blood vessel function than those without diabetes.
Measuring vascular function is used to identify the risk of heart disease.
Moving more and sitting less helps reduce the risk of heart disease. This is
true for everyone, not just people with diabetes.
However, rapidly advancing technologies in the workplace and at home are
leading to fewer opportunities for incidental activity. This is creating
lifestyles that are conducive to prolonged periods of sitting.
In the study, the team explored the effects of shorter, more frequent and
longer, less-frequent exercise breaks on blood flow and blood vessel dilation
in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Each volunteer participated in three separate trial conditions on different
days. In one, the volunteers sat for eight hours, where they could read or use
a phone, but they did not take activity breaks.
In the second, volunteers did three minutes of exercises that included squats,
leg lifts, and calf raises every 30 minutes. A finally in the third they took
The researchers found that compared with just sitting, blood vessel function
improved in both instances where volunteers exercised. But the results were
much better when the participants exercised every 30 minutes.
This suggests that the frequency of the activity break may be more important
## Frequent exercise is good for your health
As there is a progressive impairment in vascular function as type 2 diabetes
develops, frequently interrupting sitting is needed to preserve leg blood
The new findings suggest that more-frequent and shorter breaks may be more
beneficial than longer, less-frequent breaks for improving vascular function
The study is published in the American Journal of Physiology-Heart and
