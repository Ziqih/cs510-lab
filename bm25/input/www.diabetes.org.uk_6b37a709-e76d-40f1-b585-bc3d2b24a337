Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle and all children
and young people should do at least an hour of moderate to vigorous physical
activity each day. This includes things like brisk walking, very active play,
and most sports and games (eg skipping, dancing and swimming).
For children with diabetes, being active and physically fit reduces blood
pressure, lowers the levels of fats in the blood, keeps the heart healthy, and
may help to improve blood sugar levels (also known as blood glucose) and
## What’s the difference between physical activity and exercise?
Physical activity is any movement that uses skeletal muscles, while exercise
is specific structured physical activity that involves training and developing
sports skills, eg team sports, athletics and gymnastics.
* Activity increases the amount of glucose used by the muscles for energy. This means that being active may sometimes lower the blood glucose levels.
* Being active helps the body to use insulin more efficiently, and regular activity can help reduce the amount of insulin your child takes.
* Being active helps your child maintain a healthy weight for their height, which in turn will help their diabetes control.
* Be as active as possible yourself – you can be a great role model for children.
* Encourage your child to try lots of different activities – get them to have a go and see which they like.
* Remember that being active is as important as formal exercise, so encourage more walking and active play (games like hide and seek, hop scotch or even something on the Wii or other games console). Even some jobs around the house will increase activity levels.
* Encourage activity after school and at the weekends. Walking around the shops or park are also good, even if it’s just to cut down the time spent in front of a TV or computer screen.
* You can split your child’s hour into shorter active sessions of 15–20 minutes across the day.
Regular activity should be part of your child’s routine, and planning for it
will help. Being active may affect blood sugar levels and you may notice
changes during and after any physical activity. Regular blood sugar testing
will help you to understand what being active does to your child’s blood sugar
levels. Being active may cause low blood sugar levels or high blood sugar
levels – or have no effect at all.
### Activity may cause blood glucose levels to drop if:
* There is too much insulin working in your child’s body.
* The activity lasts longer than one hour.
### Activity will cause your child’s blood glucose levels to rise if:
* Your child doesn’t have enough insulin circulating in their body.
* The activity is mostly anaerobic or competitive, for example, a football match, an athletics or any sport with multiple bursts of short, sharp, fast movement.
During any activity your child will use up some of the glucose that’s stored
in their muscles and liver. They will need to replace these stores or their
blood sugar levels may drop. This usually takes around 12 hours, but can take
longer after very strenuous exercise, or if they haven’t eaten much
After exercise, your child’s insulin will be more effective, so they may
experience low blood sugar levels.You may need to adjust their insulin or food
intake to prevent delayed hypoglycaemia (hypo), so talk to your paediatric
These are general guidelines, so discuss them first with your child’s diabetes
1. Check your child’s blood sugar levels before and after activity.
2. If their blood sugar levels are above14mmol/l, check for ketones. If there are ketones, don’t allow any activity until they’ve gone.
3. If their blood sugar level is high before exercise without ketones, think about when your child last had insulin. They may need a small amount before exercise if it is more than three or four hours since their last injection/bolus.
4. Aim for blood sugar levels of 5mmol/l or more before starting any planned activity to reduce the risk of a hypo.
5. Always try to choose an injection or cannula site away from the muscles that your child is about to use (eg avoid the leg if your child’s going to play football). During exercise the blood flow to the muscles increases, speeding up the action of the insulin.
6. If your child gets active within 1-2 hours of an injection or pump bolus dose, you may need to reduce their insulin dose with a meal to help prevent a hypo. If you don’t reduce the insulin, they may need an extra snack before exercise.Talk to your diabetes team about this.
7. If your child exercises for 60 minutes or longer, make sure they have some extra carbohydrate during the activity.
8. All children should drink when they exercise. For activity lasting less than an hour, water or sugar-free squash is fine, but for activity that lasts longer than an hour, try an isotonic sports drink, pure fruit juice (mix 50/50 with water) or ordinary ‘sugar-containing’ squash.
* Tell the person in charge of the activity that your child has diabetes and ensure they know how to treat a hypo. Also make sure your child’s friends and teammates know how to recognise the signs of a hypo.
* In case of a hypo, make sure your child keeps something sugary close by, such as Lucozade, a non-diet drink, glucose tablets or gel, (plus a longer-acting carbohydrate food if necessary).
Having diabetes doesn’t stop your child from enjoying, and succeeding in,
their favourite sport. Rower Sir Steve Redgrave – five-times Olympic gold
medallist – and the all-diabetes professional cycling team, Team Novo Nordisk,
Chris Pennell was also diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 19. He is currently
in his 11th season playing professional rugby at Worcester Warriors and was
capped for England against the All Blacks. Chris has gone on to found a rugby
People with Type 1 diabetes can (and do) take part in most sports and
Although some sports-governing bodies do have restrictions on people with
diabetes, luckily this is only a few. For example, scuba diving has strict
guidelines put in place for safety reasons. Contact the relevant sporting body
or a local sports group for more information.
Think about reducing your child’s insulin dose if their meal is one to two
hours before the activity. Give them a meal or snack containing low fat
carbohydrate, including things like pasta, baked beans, porridge, milk, yogurt
Your child will probably need a carbohydrate-containing snack to help avoid a
hypo. Carrying hypo treatments like glucose tablets and cereal bars is
### How soon after a meal is the activity?
Think about reducing your child’s insulin dose with the meal before exercise
or give them a carbohydrate-containing snack before exercising. As a rough
guide, if you don’t adjust their insulin, during exercise children need at
least 1g carbohydrate for every kilo they weigh.
Your child will usually need an extra snack, such as a banana, cereal or a
cake bar, about an hour before starting the activity. How much they need
Blood sugar levels may fall during activity, so give your child some quick-
acting carbohydrate, eg sports drink, jelly sweets, jaffa cakes, and have some
Your child will need a mixture of quick-acting and longer-acting carbohydrate
options, such as fruit juice, sandwiches, fruit bars, crisps and biscuits.
They can carry these in a small rucksack along with something to treat a hypo,
Remember that everyone’s different – what might work for one child with
diabetes, might not work for another. Balancing food intake, insulin and
physical activity levels isn’t easy, and at first, will be a matter of trial
and error. Have the confidence to experiment, and check your child’s blood
glucose levels to see how they’re getting on. Your child’s diabetes team are
Active parents are more likely to have active children: remember they will
