**Updated 7 September: Following our rapid research funding call in April, we
are delighted to announce, in partnership with JDRF, Moorfields Eye Charity
and Fight for Sight, a combined commitment of £400,198 to support five new
research projects. Together these will help to drive forward our understanding
of the impact of coronavirus on people with diabetes.**
The coronavirus pandemic represents an unprecedented challenge to all of us.
New research indicates that some people with diabetes are at a higher risk of
severe illness if they catch coronavirus. The lockdown has changed peoples’
lives in many ways including their diet and activity levels, as well as access
to crucial medical appointments. It’s been a particularly challenging and
worrying time for people living with all types of diabetes.
That’s why we put out an urgent call in April for research on diabetes and
coronavirus. Recognising the urgency for people with diabetes, we accelerated
our usual funding application process, so that the research can benefit people
with diabetes as rapidly as possible. After applications closed in May, we
worked with our peer reviewers, Research Committee and Grants Advisory Panel
to identify the most promising projects from the 54 applications submitted.
Today, we can announce that we are funding four projects. Our partnerships
with JDRF and Moorfields Eye Charity mean that we are able to fund as much
high quality research, and help to address as many unanswered questions, as
Professor Kathleen Gillespie’s project, co-funded by JDRF, will contact 5,000
people with type 1 diabetes and their families, and test them for coronavirus
antibodies. This will show which people have been previously infected with the
virus. They’ll also complete a questionnaire about their experience managing
diabetes during lockdown. This will provide important information about rates
of coronavirus infection among those with type 1 diabetes and what impact
having the virus has on the management of their condition. Learn more about
Dr John Dennis from the University of Exeter will combine and study large
health databases to look in detail at different characteristics of people with
diabetes, such as their age, blood sugar levels and diabetes subtype, to
understand better which people with the condition are greater risk of poor
outcomes from coronavirus. Knowing how to spot high-risk people with diabetes
will help healthcare professionals provide better care and advice to keep them
Professor Naveed Sattar from the University of Glasgow plans to explore the
effects of the coronavirus pandemic on risk factors for diabetes
complications, including blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and body weight.
His team will use health records to look at the impact of the pandemic on
these risk factors and rates of diabetes complications over the next two
years. The team will also identify what factors, like age or ethnicity, put
people at higher risk of complications, to help us reduce inequalities in
Dr Ranjan Rajendram’s project at Moorfields Eye Hospital, co-funded by
Moorfields Eye Charity, will study people with diabetes whose treatments for
diabetes-related loss of vision has been delayed by lockdown and will track
the impact on their eye health. This could help to improve the care given to
people with diabetes during the current, and any future, lockdown, and
potentially prevent devastating sight loss. Learn more about Dr Rajendram's
Dr Miguel Bernabeu, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh, co-funded by
Fight for Sight, will investigate if people with diabetic retinopathy are at
greater risk of developing complications from coronavirus and whether this is
because the virus is more able to attack vital organs in people with diabetes.
The results of the study will allow researchers to propose new ways of
predicting coronavirus risk based on non-invasive imaging of the eye. Read
