# Our research shows new genetic test better at spotting risk of Type 1
Our scientists have discovered a new way to find children at high risk of Type
1 diabetes that’s more effective than current methods.
Our research fellow, Dr Richard Oram, at the University of Exeter and
scientists at Seattle University have developed a new ‘risk calculator’. The
calculator uses information from genes linked to Type 1 diabetes to help find
those at highest risk of developing the condition.
In a study published today in Diabetes Care, the team used computer
simulations to show that their new risk score (called the T1DGRS2) was nearly
twice as effective as current methods at finding babies at high risk of Type 1
Spotting children at high risk could help healthcare professionals to catch
any signs of Type 1 diabetes as early as possible, reducing their risk of
It also means children at high risk can be offered opportunities to take part
in cutting-edge research trials, hoping to find ways to delay or prevent Type
To develop the test, the team looked at genetic information across the entire
genome (a person’s complete set of DNA) in nearly 6,500 people with Type 1
diabetes and around 9,000 people without diabetes. They combined information
about genetic differences strongly linked to Type 1 diabetes into a score.
To test how well their new risk score worked, they wanted to see if it could
spot people who already had Type 1 diabetes. So they tested it in a subset of
people in the UK Biobank: a database of nearly half a million people, many of
whom have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.
The team found that the new risk score was 50% better than current genetic
scores at finding adults with Type 1 diabetes. Although these tests aren’t
used currently, the findings show that as well as helping to spot children at
high risk, the tests could be used to make sure people receive the right
diabetes diagnosis in the future - and therefore the right treatments - as
Exeter scientists recently discovered that around half of all cases of Type 1
diabetes happen in adulthood. But it can sometimes be difficult for doctors to
distinguish between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
