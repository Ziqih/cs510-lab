... Smart insulin patch could monitor and manage glucose levels
# Smart insulin patch could monitor and manage glucose levels
Researchers in the US have developed a smart insulin-delivery patch that could
one day monitor and manage glucose levels in people living with diabetes and
deliver the necessary insulin dosage. The adhesive patch, about the size of a
10 cent piece, is intended for once-a-day use.
The study, published in _Nature Biomedical Engineering_ , describes results
conducted in the lab on mice and pigs. The team in now applying for FDA
The adhesive patch monitors blood glucose. It has doses of insulin pre-loaded
in very tiny microneedles, less than one-millimeter in length that deliver
medicine quickly when the blood glucose levels reach a certain threshold. When
blood glucose returns to normal, the patch's insulin delivery also slows down.
The researchers said the advantage is that it can help prevent overdosing of
insulin, which can lead to hypoglycemia, seizures, coma or even death.
"It has always been a dream to achieve insulin-delivery in a smart and
convenient manner," said study co-author John Buse, Director of the UNC
Diabetes Center and the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences (NC
"This smart insulin patch, if proven safe and effective in human trials, would
The treatment for diabetes hasn't changed much in past decades. Patients with
diabetes draw blood to measures glucose levels and then administer the
necessary dose of insulin. Currently insulin can be injected with a needle and
syringe, a pen or insulin pump. A smart insulin patch would sense the need for
The microneedles used in the patch are made with a glucose-sensing polymer
that's encapsulated with insulin. Once applied on the skin, the microneedles
penetrate under the skin and can sense blood sugar levels. If glucose levels
go up, the polymer is triggered to release the insulin. Each microneedle is
smaller than a regular needle used to draw blood and do not reach as deeply,
so the patch is less painful than a pin prick. Each microneedle penetrates
about a half millimeter below the skin, which is sufficient to deliver insulin
Laboratory tests have shown the patch to successfully control glucose levels
Our main goal is to enhance health and improve the quality of life for people
living with diabetes. This smart patch takes away the need to constantly check
blood sugar and then inject insulin if and when it's needed. It mimics the
regulatory function of the pancreas but in a way that's easy to use," said
Zhen Gu, study co-author from the UNC Department of Biomedical Engineering
The technology has been accepted into the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's
Emerging Technology Program. Researchers are applying for FDA approval for
human clinical trials, which they anticipate could start within a few years.
The team envisions that the smart microneedle patch could also be adapted with
different drugs to manage other medical conditions as well.
