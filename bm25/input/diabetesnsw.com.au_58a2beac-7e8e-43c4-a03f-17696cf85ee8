# Scientists visualise diabetes-related proteins at high resolution
Scientists have examined a key receptor for the first time at high resolution
- broadening understanding of how it might function, and opening the door to
future improvements in treating conditions such as type 2 diabetes - a
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors (GLP1R) are found on insulin-producing beta
cells of the pancreas and neurons in the brain. The receptor encourages the
pancreas to release more insulin, stops the liver from producing too much
glucose, and reduces appetite. This combination of effects can help to control
As such, GLP1R has become a significant target for the treatment of type 2
diabetes, and a range of drugs are now available that are based on it. But
much remains unknown about GLP1R function because its small size makes it
An international group of scientists led by experts at the **University of
Birmingham** and the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg,
have now conducted a detailed examination of the receptor in living cells.
Researchers used a number of techniques - including synthesis of marker
compounds, immunostaining, super-resolution microscopy, as well as 'in vivo'
examination of mice. They were able to label GLP1R with their developed
fluorescent probes so as to show its location in the cells and its response to
Publishing their findings in _Nature Communications_ , the researchers - who
were partly funded by Diabetes UK - note that they now provide a
comprehensively tested and unique GLP1R detection toolbox, which has updated
our view of this receptor, with implications for the treatment of conditions

 **" Our research allows us to visualise this key receptor in much more detail
than before. Think about watching a movie in standard definition versus 4k,
that's how big the difference is. We believe this breakthrough will give us a
much greater understanding of GLP1R distribution and function."**
"Whilst this will not immediately change treatment for patients, it might
influence how we design drugs in the future."
Johannes Broichhagen, Departmental Group Leader of the Max-Planck Institute
for Medical Research, commented: "Our experiments, made possible by combining
expertise in chemistry and cell biology, will improve our understanding of
GLP1R in the pancreas and the brain. Our new tools have been used in stem
cells and in the living animal to visualize this important receptor, and we
provide the first super-resolution characterisation of a class B GPCR.
Importantly, our results suggest a degree of complexity not readily
Dr Elizabeth Robertson, Director of Research at Diabetes UK commented: "The
effects of type 2 diabetes are serious and widespread, so finding more
effective treatments to help people manage their condition and reduce their
risk of its potentially devastating complications is absolutely vital.
"Through innovative research like this, we can get to grips with key aspects
of type 2 diabetes in unprecedented detail, and blaze a trail towards better
GLP1R is a member of the so-called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which
play a role in many of the body's functions. An increased understanding of how
they work has greatly affected modern medicine, and today, it is estimated
that between one-third and one-half of all marketed drugs act by binding to
