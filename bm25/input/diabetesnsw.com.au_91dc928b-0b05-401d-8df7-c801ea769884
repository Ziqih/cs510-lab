Australians are more likely to go to a café for coffee or tea than to eat out
at a fast-food place, and having a meal at the pub is now vastly more popular
than getting a pizza home-delivered, according to a recently released report
from Roy Morgan. The study compared results from 2006 with 2016 and found the
most striking difference over the last 10 years has been our ever-more
widespread penchant for going to cafes. Back in 2006, 51.1% of Aussies visited
a café at least once in an average three months; since then, this has risen to
While the proportion of Aussies going to the pub solely for a drink has
dropped, more of us are going to the pub to eat. Dining at licensed
restaurants has also become more popular and the proportion of us who agree
that ‘’If I could afford to eat out every night I would” has crept up from
Almost three quarters of the population (72.4%) now say they enjoy food from
all over the world (up from 65.5% in 2006), while 57.3% report buying much

Aussies made an effort to buy it, compared with 46.0% in 2006); as has buying

descriptions than they were 10 years ago speaks volumes about our ongoing
obsession with food and gourmet culture. With TV cooking shows and celebrity
chefs as popular as ever, it’s almost a matter of pride for many people to
visit the latest restaurant or café before their friends: home-delivered pizza
“Connected to this is the inexorable rise of café society. Visiting cafes,
whether for a drink or a meal (or both) is booming, and shows no sign of
slowing even as heading to the pub for a drink has lost ground. While it’s
tempting to assume this is all part of a move towards healthier living, Roy
