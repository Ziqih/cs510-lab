>>>>>>> #### Diagnosed with type 1 at four years old
>>>>>>>> Having gastroparesis puts a lot of pressure on your marriage and your
life but as I’m getting older, I think I appreciate life more. I realise my
situation might be a bit bad at times, but it’s not the end of the world.
>>>>>>> Karen was diagnosed with gastroparesis when she was 25. It's a
diabetes complication caused by nerve damage, which stops food from moving
through the stomach as quickly as it should. Here Karen shares her story of
managing gastroparesis while continuing to work in the NHS.
>>>>>>> I remember being really thirsty and not being able to stop wetting the
bed and not knowing what was up with me. Then I have a memory blank, and the
next thing I recall is being in hospital and being given an orange to inject
into. I was told that I’d have to do this every day for the rest of my life,
but no-one ever explained why I’d have to do this every day for the rest of my
>>>>>>> I was told I couldn’t eat baked beans or bananas, because that was the
advice at the time, but no-one ever explained why. Nothing about my condition
was explained. I moved from Ireland to the UK ten years after my diagnosis,
and that was when I first started to get more of an understanding of diabetes.
>>>>>>> When someone finally did explain what diabetes was, I felt really hard
done by! I thought, ‘so I can’t do this, and I can’t do that.’ Injecting never
bothered me. It bothered other people more. I thought, ‘well, I need this to
stay alive.’ People would sometimes stare or even call me a drug user, but it
>>>>>>> People would sometimes stare or even call me a drug user when I
injected, but it never bothered me at all.
>>>>>>> When I was young, it was hard because I couldn’t understand why I
couldn’t eat sweets or have sugary drinks. God bless my mum, she didn’t
understand either. So, Mum never went out of her way to give me sugar-free
drinks. She used to bake cakes and would never tell me I couldn’t have any.
When my sugars went really high, the GP would just come out and give me a big

>>>>>>> I probably wasn’t the best at taking care of my diabetes in my teens.
I always took my injections, but I did drink and eat whatever I wanted. It
wasn’t until I got into my early twenties that I decided I needed to pull my
>>>>>>> I got married in 1998, and I’d been sick a few times that year, but I
didn’t think anything of it. The following spring, I was sick every day for
about three months. I was in and out of hospital and was even referred to a
psychiatrist because they thought I was making myself sick because I was
>>>>>>> Late that summer, when I was 25, a doctor told me he thought I had
gastroparesis. I’d never heard of that, so when a test confirmed it, I was
relieved to know that my illness wasn’t in my head.
>>>>>>> Gastroparesis a long-term complication of diabetes that can be caused
by fluctuating blood sugars causing nerve damage (neuropathy). Damage to these
nerves can result in gastroparesis, where food isn’t moved out of the stomach
as quickly as normal. It’s thought to be the result of a problem with the
nerves and muscles that control how the stomach empties. Symptoms of this can
include bloating, constipation, diarrhoea, having pain or discomfort in the
upper part of the tummy, and feeling or being sick. Having gastroparesis means
your food is being digested slowly, and at unpredictable times, which can
>>>>>>> When gastroparesis flares up, it can last for anything from 24 hours
>>>>>>> When I was diagnosed, the reality of what gastroparesis actually is
hit me. I had a really nice nurse at the time, the sort of nurse who would get
down and hug you, and she said, ‘you’ve got this complication, it will change
your life, but you can’t let it ruin your life.’
>>>>>>> I remember sitting on the hospital bed thinking, ‘is this how I’m
going to feel all the time? Am I going to be sick all the time?’
>>>>>>> For the past eight years, I’ve had botox injected into my muscles
every ten weeks. The botox kind of ‘paralyses’ the muscle, to prevent it from
>>>>>>> I had a really nice nurse at the time and she said, ‘you’ve got this
complication, it will change your life, but you can’t let it ruin your life.’

>>>>>>> Balancing diabetes and gastroparesis can be a nightmare, particularly
if you’re being sick and are going hypo. Sometimes you can suck a sweet, or
I’ve tried glucose gel, which works quite well. When I first got
gastroparesis, I stopped eating healthier foods, because they took longer to
digest. Running the risk that what I ate was going to get stuck in my tummy, I
didn’t want food that was going to keep me fuller for longer!
>>>>>>> I love vegetables and had previously had a healthy diet, but I gave up
eating dark green vegetables because I’d experience a cramping in my gut. I
didn’t really eat brown bread, either. Then if I did eat those sorts of
things, because they were new to my system, digesting them was quite
>>>>>>> In January 2020, a comment from the doctor who was giving me my botox
made me realise I needed to lose a bit of weight and get fitter. I Googled a
lot and looked at calories on packets and worked out how thing affect my
system. Then, I started off slowly and gradually increased fibre and fruit in
>>>>>>> The first 21 days were difficult. At one point I thought, ‘I just need
to stop this.’ But then I told myself to keep going, that my gut would get
used to these changes. And it has. It’s been really good.
>>>>>>> It took about a month for my system to get used to it. Thanks to my
botox treatment, if I have a sandwich now, I can choose brown bread over white
and I eat loads more fruit and vegetables. I also try not to take it to the
>>>>>>> I also started walking more. I do about two hours a day now. I leave
early, then do a lap around the hospital where I work, which is about a mile.
I often have to go to the pharmacy at the other end of the hospital, so that
involves more walking. Then at lunchtime I get a 20-minute break so I then do
another lap, and then I do two in the evening, which is nearly two miles.
Because I’m only doing it for 20-25 minutes at a time, it feels easy. And
while I found going to the gym made me have bad hypos, walking doesn’t make my
sugars drop as drastically, so it’s more manageable for me.
>>>>>>> Recently, at my annual diabetic review, I discovered my HbA1C had gone
from 59mmol/mol to 54. I was so made up! I’m hoping it’ll be even lower at my
>>>>>>> Changing my eating habits – I don’t want to call it a ‘diet’ – and
making lifestyle changes have made such a difference.

>>>>>>> I’m married, I have two sons, and I work three days a week in an NHS
admin role. I used to get stressed that my gastroparesis would mean having to
take time off work. The stress, in turn, affects the gastroparesis. I
eventually got to the point where I thought, ‘I’ve got this condition. I
didn’t ask for it. There’s nothing I can do about it.’ I just had to accept
it! Once I realised that, I stopped getting so stressed. Now, I haven’t had to
take sick leave for nearly two years. I know it will flare up, I will end up
in hospital every so often, but I just have to ride it out.
>>>>>>> Having gastroparesis puts a lot of pressure on your marriage and your
life. I’d be throwing up by my husband still had to go to work and I had to
get the kids to school. It was hard at the time. My kids are older now, nearly
17 and 19. Now that they can look after themselves, I don’t stress as much. It

situation might be a bit bad at times, but it’s not the end of the world.
>>>>>>> Gastroparesis has been really tough, but having diabetes has never
bothered me. Obviously I’d rather not have it, but it’s never affected my
mental health. It’s just something that I’ve got and I feel that there are
other people out there with worse illnesses than diabetes. My view is that you
can’t live like it’s the end of the world. I’ve got diabetes, I just have to
