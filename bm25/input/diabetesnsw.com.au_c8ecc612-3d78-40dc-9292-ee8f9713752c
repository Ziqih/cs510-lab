 _Written by Thomas Liang, Accredited Exercise Physiologist_
Do you keep setting a goal to 'get fitter' or 'exercise more' but struggle to
find the time or motivation? Here are our top four tips for getting into
##**Step 1: Set yourself a goal to work towards**
Setting daily, weekly and monthly goals gives you direction and assists with
keeping you on track towards greater fitness and improved health and diabetes
The below example will give you some ideas on how to set **SMART** goals:
 **S** (specific), **M** (measureable), **A** (achievable), **R** ealistic
 _Daily Goal_ _ - _ sit less throughout the day.
* I will achieve this by getting up in the TV ad breaks, walking around the house while I wait for the jug to boil and by walking to the mail box three times throughout the day, before breakfast, lunch and dinner.
* FACT: This increase in incidental activity reduces your sitting time which is important to lower your blood glucose levels (BGLs) and help reduce the risk of other health-related conditions such as heart disease.
 _Weekly Goal_ - exercise five days per week for 30 minutes.
* I will do this at 9am Monday to Friday.
* FACT: 30 minutes of exercise will enable you to match the recommended health guidelines for the Australian population to remain healthy and reduce the risk of health complications.
 _Monthly Goal_ - Reach a total of 20 exercise sessions over the month which
* Increase my step count by an average extra 500 steps per day from my step count on week 1 of my tracking.
* FACT: 10,000 steps per day is recommended to reduce health risks.
It's extremely important if you are new to exercise or activity that you
_gradually_ build up your fitness levels. The best way to do this is start out
with a form of activity you **enjoy** and is achievable for you to apply into
your day to day routine. Walking is a great way to become healthier and more
active. Other forms of activity such as cycling, swimming, dancing/zumba are
common examples and just as beneficial to build up your fitness levels. An
example of how you can build up your fitness progressively is provided below

Planning your activity will be your key to your success! “Without a plan your
goals are just a wish.” A simple tool like this will help you schedule
exercise into your day and make it a priority. Plan A may not work so try
again and again until you find a plan that works for you and your day to day
Use technology to help you stay on track with your activity levels and fitness
goals. The following free phone apps may be useful:
