coronavirus and pool closures, remember that the challenge doesn’t start until
22 April 2021. Sign up today and we’ll keep you regularly updated. And we’d be
there to support you every stroke, length and mile of the way, as soon as you
feel ready to return to the pool (and it is safe for you to do so).
There are three distances to choose from which are taken at your own pace, in
your own pool over three months - individually or as a team.
* 11 miles: ‘The Half’ – Half the distance to France, still an impressive feat.
* 22 miles: ‘The Full’ - The distance of the English Channel, our most popular choice.
* 44 miles: ‘The Double’ – To France and back, for the more adventurous.
Whichever distance you choose, there’s no better feeling than diving into a
challenge you’ll love knowing each length you complete will lead to a
healthier you and a better future for people living with diabetes.
