If you are a fan of social media you would’ve no doubt seen an array of ‘meal
prep’ snaps or videos cross the World Wide Web. Not only does meal prep make
for a great photo but, done right, it can support healthier living. Meal
planning and preparation can help you get a **good mix of nutrition** and save
you **money** , **time** and **stress**. The key is to combine planning with
 ** _The first step_** is to know what to aim for. The Australian Guide to
Healthy Eating is a great place to start. Aim to get a variety of nutritious
foods from the five healthy food groups including
* Lean meat and poultry, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds, and legumes (beans)
* Milk, yoghurt, cheese and/or alternatives (mostly reduced fat)

When considering how to balance your meals and boost your intake of the five
healthy food groups use this handy-guide to help.
You may need to tweak this to meet your own individual needs, but it's a good
 ** _The next step_** is to plan your dinner meals. Begin by considering your
protein choice, then mix and match your carbohydrate and veggie options based
on this. Ideally aim for at least one meat-free day during the week by
experimenting with options such as lentils, beans, chickpeas, tofu, eggs, nuts
or other meat-free protein sources. For the rest of the week aim to include
lean red meat one to two times, skinless chicken or poultry one to two times
and fish/seafood (especially oily fish like tuna or salmon) two to three times
per week. Keep in mind deli, processed or smoked meats tend to be higher in
salt and saturated fat and increase our risk of health problems. Limit these
foods as much as possible. **_Next_** base your lunchtime meals on leftovers
or quick and easy ideas to save you time and avoid food waste.
Skinless chicken or turkey| Brown and/or low GI rice| Lettuce
Tofu| Beans (e.g. kidney beans, baked beans)*| Onion
Beans (e.g. kidney beans, baked beans)*| Lentils*| Green beans
* These are good sources of both carbohydrate and lean protein.
MONDAY| Canned tuna, quinoa and salad| Steak with sweet potato and vegetables
TUESDAY| Leftover steak sandwich with salad and a little tomato chutney| Roast
chicken, potato and roast vegetables (e.g. zucchini, carrot, mushrooms, etc)
WEDNESDAY| Frittata or omelette with leftover roast veggies| Leftover roast
chicken with stir-fried vegetables and low GI brown rice
 ** _After this_** create a shopping list. It also helps to have the pantry,
fridge and freezer stocked with kitchen essentials as well. Consider adding
* Grains: quinoa, rolled oats, barley, brown/ low GI rice, wholemeal pasta, cous cous
* Canned tomato/ tomato paste, beetroot and corn (no added salt varieties)
* Dried or canned lentils, beans, chickpeas, etc. (no added salt varieties)
* Cooking oils: spray, olive, canola, sesame / peanut
* Fresh food – potatoes, sweet potato, onion, garlic, ginger
* Frozen fresh lean varieties of meat, chicken or seafood
 ** _Prioritise_** an hour or so during your week to cook your meals a head of
time. Where possible cook your ingredients in bulk batches and portion out
into freezer containers or zip lock bags. Don’t forget to label and date your
meals to help you navigate the freezer later in the week.
