>>>>>>> Information on pregnancy and contraception should be given to all
women with diabetes of childbearing age. There are no contraceptive methods
that are specifically contraindicated in women with diabetes. Methods with
proven high degrees of effectiveness are to be preferred.
>>>>>>> Women planning a pregnancy should have a medical, dietetic,
educational, drug, obstetric and gynaecological history taken. Metformin may
be used together with, or in place of, insulin during preconception and
throughout pregnancy. All other blood glucose lowering medications should be
stopped before pregnancy and replaced with insulin. If the woman is taking any
other medication that is not recommended in pregnancy – eg ACE inhibitors,
statins, diuretics or beta-blockers – steps should be taken to remedy this
before conception, or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.
>>>>>>> Diabetic complications should be assessed and treated if indicated. A
baseline retinal examination and assessment of microalbuminuria (protein in
urine) should be performed pre conception. Diabetic retinopathy, if present,
can accelerate during pregnancy. All women with diabetes should be made aware
of the requirement to have regular retinal examinations during pregnancy.
Untreated cardiovascular disease is associated with a high mortality, and
>>>>>>> The woman should have access to members of the multidisciplinary team
specialist diabetes dietitians, specialist diabetes nurses and special
diabetes midwives. The woman with diabetes (and her partner) should be
included as members of the team, be involved in decisions about their care and
be offered the opportunity to make choices by provision of appropriate and
>>>>>>> Blood glucose control should be optimised to prevent congenital
malformations. Any improvement in HbA1c towards the target (ie less than
48mmol/mol) should be encouraged taking into account the risk of
hypoglycaemia. Women with HbA1c above 86mmol/mol should be strongly advised to
>>>>>>> Goals should be jointly set with the woman for self-monitored glucose,
having established that the woman can use her blood glucose meter to produce
results that are +/-0.5 mmol/l when compared to a reference technique. Such
quality assurance methods should be available through the hospital laboratory.
>>>>>>> Diabetes UK realises that in addition each blood glucose monitoring
system will vary by at least 10 per cent from a reference value. Individual
meters will also vary from the method mean. These figures must therefore be
>>>>>>> All blood glucose meters give a glucose result that is a plasma value.
Plasma values are approximately 11 to 12 per cent higher than whole blood

>>>>>>> The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial showed that attempts to
achieve tight glycaemic control in people with Type 1 diabetes increases the
risk of severe hypoglycaemia. Severe, frequent or unexplained episodes of
hypoglycaemia are due to a number of factors, including:
>>>>>>> There is no evidence that such hypoglycaemia is an independent risk to
the developing human embryo. The mother, however, is clearly at risk, and the
woman with diabetes contemplating pregnancy should have that explained to her.
Means of prevention and treatment (GlucoGel and glucagon) should be provided
to her and her family, as appropriate. It is essential to include family
members and friends of the patient in the education.
>>>>>>> After the initial visit, the woman should have access to phone or
other contact details for adjustment of insulin doses and other aspects of
treatment. Once the woman has achieved stable glycaemic control (assessed by
monthly HbA1c) that is as good as she can achieve, she can then be counselled
about the risk of malformations and spontaneous abortions. When she wishes,
contraception can be discontinued. If conception does not occur within one
year, the woman and her partner’s fertility should be assessed.
>>>>>>> *This recommendation is from the new NICE guidelines for the
management of diabetes in pregnancy. NICE recommmends that women with diabetes
who are planning for pregnancy should aim for the same blood glucose levels
recommended for all adults with Type 1 diabetes. These target ranges are taken
from the updated NICE guidelines for Type 1 diabetes which is due for
