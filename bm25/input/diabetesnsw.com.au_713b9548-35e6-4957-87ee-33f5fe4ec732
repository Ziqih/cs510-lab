## Balance exercises that reduce your risk of falls
The test of time is not easy on our bodies. Whether it’s your ability to
complete household tasks, or simply walk to the shops, frailty can become a
problem. One aspect of your physical health that often goes unnoticed,
however, is the increased risk of falls that comes with frailty.
The risk of falls increases significantly as we age, but why? Simply put, the
physical and cognitive changes associated with age impact our ability to
maintain an upright posture, use our small and sensitive stabilising muscles,
and slow our reactions to prevent a fall from occurring in the first place.
Falls can lead to injury, with 37.3 million falls resulting in some form of
medical attention according to the World Health Organization. This can be
particularly troublesome for people living with diabetes, considering some of
the factors that can occur with foot health and sensation.
So, considering the importance of preventing a fall, what can you do?
Simply put, exercise! The degeneration in those stabilising muscles and the
cognitive changes that occur can’t be stopped, but they can be managed and
reversed to the best of our ability through physical activity.

* ### Safety is the most important aspect
Similar to the general risk of falls, completing balance exercises without
ensuring the area is safe can increase your risk of injury. Make sure you’ve
cleared the area of any potential trip hazards or objects that may cause harm.
Perform balance exercises with appropriate safety measures considered, such as
using a chair, bed, or wall for support.
* ### Balance exercises can often become a mental challenge as well as physical
Balance exercises require patience. It’s important to start slowly, not only
for your own safety, but to ensure you stick to your goals and improve your
Try not to get frustrated if you can’t quite hold a pose or complete an
exercise without a few stumbles! It might be a good indicator for you to try
something a little bit easier, and slowly work up to where you would like to
be. For example, if you’re unable to hold a Single Leg Balance, try a Tandem
Stance without walking first. Or if it’s too simple, try throwing a ball up
and down, or slowly looking in different directions.
Balance and falls risk is an important aspect of your overall health and
wellbeing. Taking a few minutes out of each day to complete balance exercises
could be the difference between a potential fall or not.
If you have any issues or concerns about completing the above-mentioned
exercises, consult with your GP or an Accredited Exercise Physiologist.
