 **With more than 20 teaspoons of sugar in one hit, new ad campaign shows
A cheeky, graphic counter-campaign taking on cheap frozen drink promotions
like $1 Slurpees and Frozen Cokes has hit Victorian bus and tram stops to urge
Rather than tempt viewers with a frosty, frozen drink, the “Don’t Be Sucked
In” campaign from LiveLighter and Rethink Sugary Drink, an alliance of 18
leading health agencies, shows a person sipping on a large cup of bulging
Craig Sinclair, Chair of Cancer Council Australia’s Public Health Committee,
said while this graphic advertisement isn’t easy to look at, it clearly
illustrates the risks of drinking too many sugary drinks.
“Frozen drinks in particular contain ridiculous amounts of added sugar – even
“A mega $3 Slurpee contains more than 20 teaspoons of sugar. That’s the same
amount of sugar as nearly eight lemonade icy poles, and more than three times
the maximum recommended by the World Health Organisation of six teaspoons a
“At this time of year it’s almost impossible to escape the enormous amount of
advertising and promotions for frozen drink specials on TV, social media and
“These cheap frozen drinks might seem refreshing on a hot day, but we want
people to realise they could easily be sucking down an entire week’s worth of
A large frozen drink from most outlets costs just $1 – a deal that major
outlets like 7-Eleven, McDonald’s, Hungry Jacks and KFC promote heavily.
LiveLighter campaign manager and dietitian Alison McAleese said drinking a
large Slurpee every day this summer could result in nearly 2kg of weight gain
in a year if these extra kilojoules aren’t burnt off.
“This summer, Aussies could be slurping their way towards weight gain, obesity
and toxic fat, increasing their risk of 13 types of cancer, type 2 diabetes,
heart and kidney disease, stroke and tooth decay,” Ms McAleese said.
“When nearly two thirds of Aussie adults and a third of kids are overweight or
obese, it’s completely irresponsible for these companies to be actively
promoting excessive consumption of drinks completely overloaded with sugar.
“And while this campaign focuses on the weight-related health risks, we can’t
ignore the fact that sugary drinks are also a leading cause of tooth decay in
Australia, with nearly half of children aged 2– 16 drinking soft drink every
“We’re hoping once people realise just how unhealthy these frozen drinks are,
they consider looking to other options to cool off.
“Water is ideal, but even one lemonade icy pole, with 2.7tsp of sugar, is a
far better option than a Slurpee or Frozen Coke.”
Mr Sinclair said a health levy on sugary drinks is one of the policy tools
needed to help address the growing impact of weight and diet-related health
“Not only can a 20% health levy help deter people from these cheap and very
unhealthy drinks, it will help recover some of the significant costs
associated with obesity and the increasing burden this puts on our public
