>>>>>>> We’re focusing this month’s spotlight on the Sheffield Group. The
group has run online meetings since the coronavirus lockdown in March. They
also ran a big event in January all about diabetes and exercise, and have won
a local group and community Inspire Award for their achievements. We spoke to
some of the hardworking committee; Anita, Glynis, Brenda and Linsay to find
>>>>>>> ### **History of the group and committee**
>>>>>>> The Sheffield group dates back to the 1950s and does so much for their
local community; raising awareness of diabetes, running activities and events,
fundraising for the group and for diabetes research and offering an
opportunity for people with diabetes to talk to others with the condition.
>>>>>>> Glynis, the current longest serving committee member, joined the group
with her husband Phil in 2004. She’s held a variety of roles over the years
>>>>>>> Brenda, vice-chair of the group, was misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes
15 years ago before finding out that she has type 1. She joined the group to
learn more about diabetes. As time went on, Brenda got more involved in
patient participation and then fundraising for the group.
>>>>>>> Linsay was diagnosed with type 1 when she was 2 years old. She first
found out about the group through living with diabetes days in Sheffield and
>>>>>>> Finally Anita, group chair, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in
2011. She says “I knew quite a lot about diabetes through my job as a GP. When
it’s you, it’s a bit different. I needed support and went to meetings; I
learnt a lot from a different point of view. Instead of giving out
information, I was taking it in and I was very grateful it was there.”
>>>>>>> When they’re organising an event, the committee meets every month and
talks to each other in between. Since lockdown, they’ve come together
virtually each month for both committee and group meetings.
>>>>>>> One of the group’s highlights was the ‘Move More’ event in January
2020. Sheffield’s Move More partnership had been promoting being active and
was a great help in getting this event off the ground. The event was open for
anyone with any type of diabetes and aimed to help them to be confident to
>>>>>>> Linsay’s son was diagnosed with type 1 in 2003 and they went on a
cycling holiday that summer. “We both had to reduce our insulin because
exercise made us more sensitive to it; we kept doing our blood tests and my
son, who was in the honeymoon phase post diagnosis, didn’t always need insulin
for food because of the activity! On the other side of that though is that
hypos can be a complete pain when you want to be active and can put people
off, despite all the fabulous benefits from moving such as it boosting mental
health and resilience. We also knew of people with type 2 who are in remission
through exercise (some who’d even been on insulin) so our main themes were
>>>>>>> Linsay looked online for diabetes healthcare professionals with an
interest in exercise and emailed several to ask if they would like to speak at
the event. Professor Rob Andrews, who co-founded the Exercise for Type 1
>>>>>>> “I was bowled over when my phone rang and he offered to come”, Linsay
says. “People’s enthusiasm and support didn’t stop there; Jerry Gore who’s a
Blue Circle Champion came, as did Lynne Dawson, an international swimmer,
Diana Maynard who’s registered blind yet runs, climbs and treks, and Gavin
Griffiths – DiAthlete who does motivational work with children with diabetes;
they all have diabetes and combine it with being very active and fit. We were
also thrilled that people joined us who had managed to get their type 2
diabetes into remission years after they were diagnosed. This is so
>>>>>>> With the help of our Northern office, the group contacted Muhammad
Ali, a professional boxer with type 1 diabetes who supports our work. He
agreed to come and speak at the event, and even joined in the dancing.
>>>>>>> In addition to speakers, workshops and stalls, City Limits, a
Sheffield dance school, ran a dancing class in the lunch break, teaching
attendees how to cha-cha. The dance class was perfect, Linsay says, they had
great music, many joined in, and it was such fun and showed that everyone
>>>>>>> The committee also credit the diabetes team in Sheffield and local GPs
and practice nurses who are really supportive of the group. Professor Simon
Heller was a brilliant master of ceremonies, and dieticians from Sheffield and
Leeds came, along with Karon Major from the local DESMOND team.
>>>>>>> ### **Adapting to the lockdown and moving online**
>>>>>>> When the pandemic began and the UK went into a national lockdown, the
group had to cancel their March meeting, but their April meeting went ahead
virtually. Our Northern office supported with this initially. Further help was
provided by Glynis and by David, the group’s treasurer.
>>>>>>> Adapting to running activities online was a challenge at first because
not everyone had the technology and a stable internet connection. The group
already had speakers booked in to talk and this gave them an incentive to keep
>>>>>>> “We wanted to try and keep going during lockdown and to some extent
that’s been successful. Unfortunately some people who used to join us
regularly haven’t been able to, but others have joined by phone” says Anita.
>>>>>>> Whilst some members haven’t been able to join the online meetings,
possibly through holding their meetings virtually, the group have attracted
new people to join them from other parts of the UK.
>>>>>>>> “We’ve talked about keeping some meetings online when we come out of
lockdown. We do have some older members who find it difficult to get into town
in the winter months. We also might think about recording or streaming the
meetings so people can still join in through Zoom who live outside Sheffield
or find it difficult to get into the town centre.”
>>>>>>> Another advantage of doing meetings online, Brenda explains, is that
people can join without video if they prefer to and don’t need to give their
real name. They don’t have to stay until the very end and it’s flexible.
>>>>>>> The group are keen to continue running despite the challenges the
pandemic presents. They’re realistic that they won’t be able to get out and
>>>>>>> The next event the group are planning for is their winter social and
quiz on 10 December, which will of course take place online. A local artist
has offered up their skills for a raffle prize for the social – a painting of
photo of a pet of the winner’s choice.
>>>>>>> The group have a programme planned for next year and speakers booked
for their meetings. They’d like to do an event for World Diabetes Day 2021 and
they’re always thinking of new ideas, as a committee and as a group.
>>>>>>> One wish that they have is for the group to reflect Sheffield’s
diversity more and to also attract some younger people. They’d also love to
help people with type 2 diabetes to put their diabetes into remission.
>>>>>>> “We’ve loved working together and had a lot of fun at meetings and
events. The group’s really important and has brought a lot to people in the
community. There are enough people that we know we’ve made a difference to, to
feel that it’s very well worth carrying on and building on what we’ve got,”
>>>>>>> Linsay closes by saying “it’s wonderful meeting other people with
diabetes. It’s such a boost knowing others have the same frustrations – and
have good ways to get round them! People are so accepting and helpful, kind
and compassionate. We try to make everyone feel welcome at the group. We also
really value and appreciate the contribution that everyone brings.”
