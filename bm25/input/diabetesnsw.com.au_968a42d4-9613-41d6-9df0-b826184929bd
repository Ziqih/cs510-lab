A new computer algorithm has been developed that can predict women in the
early stages of pregnancy, who may be at a high risk of gestational diabetes –
according to a study by researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science.
The study analyzed data on nearly 600,000 pregnancies and using predictions
found it may be possible to prevent gestational diabetes using nutritional and
“Our ultimate goal is to help the health system take measures so as to prevent
diabetes from occurring in pregnancy,” said senior author Prof. Eran Segal.
Gestational diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels that develop
during pregnancy in women who did not previously have diabetes. About one in
seven Australian women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes during
Typically, gestational diabetes is diagnosed between the 24th and 28th weeks
of pregnancy, with the help of a glucose tolerance test and blood.
In the new study, Segal and colleagues started out by applying a machine
learning method to the health records of 450,000 pregnancies in women who gave
birth between 2010 and 2017. Gestational diabetes had been diagnosed by
glucose tolerance testing in about 4 percent of these pregnancies.
After processing big data – an enormous dataset made up of more than 2,000
parameters for each pregnancy, including the woman’s blood test results and
her and her family’s medical histories – the scientists’ algorithm revealed
that nine of the parameters were sufficient to accurately identify the women
who were at a high risk of developing gestational diabetes.
The nine parameters included the woman’s age, body mass index, family history
of diabetes and results of her glucose tests during previous pregnancies (if
Next, to make sure that the nine parameters could indeed accurately predict
the risk of gestational diabetes, the researchers applied them to the health
records on about 140,000 additional pregnancies that had not been part of the
initial analysis. The results validated the study’s findings: The nine
parameters helped to accurately identify the women who ultimately developed
These findings suggest that by having a woman answer just nine questions, it
should be possible to tell in advance whether she is at a high risk of
developing gestational diabetes. And if this information is available early on
– in the early stages of pregnancy or even before the woman has gotten
pregnant – it might be possible to reduce her risk of diabetes through
lifestyle measures such as exercise and diet. On the other hand, women
identified by the questionnaire as being at a low risk of gestational diabetes
may be spared the cost and inconvenience of the glucose testing.
In more general terms, this study has demonstrated the usefulness of large
human-based datasets, specifically electronic health records, for deriving
personalized disease predictions that can lead to preventive and therapeutic
