There isn’t one type of activity that’s best for everyone with diabetes. It’s
about finding what works for you and depends on lots of things, like what you
enjoy, where you are and how much time you have. Think about how activity can
fit in with your life, not the other way around. And work towards adding in

If you need to start off at an easier pace, try standing during a TV advert.
If you can manage it, work towards standing for the whole advert break, then
to walking on the spot during adverts. You can mix this up by doing stretches
instead, or jogging on the spot while the ads are on. This will help you get
Everyone’s different, and some people find video workouts helpful to keep them

experts. But remember to warm your body up first, try this warm-up video from

If you have diabetes complications, like problems with your eyes and feet,
you’ll need to think a bit more about the activity you choose. For example, if

activity like jogging. Chair-based exercises might be better for you, like

Being physically active can affect blood sugar levels in different ways,
depending on the type of activity you’re doing.
We know a lot of people don’t want to exercise because it can lower their
blood sugars. You might be constantly worried about hypos, and that’s
understandable. But did you know that not all types of exercise make your
blood sugars go down? Some make them go up too.
Understanding more about what happens before, during and after you’re active
could help ease some of this worry and also manage how your levels fluctuate.
If you check your blood sugars yourself, whether that’s using some diabetes
technology or test strips, try doing this more often around the time you’re
getting active. Trial and error can really help you spot patterns, but
remember to stay safe – check out our tips on managing blood sugars.
But it’s not an exact science. Some days you’ll do exactly the same type of
activity and eat the same foods, but your blood sugar levels may act
differently to what you’d expect. This can be really frustrating, but it’s
completely normal. Anything from hormones to the weather can affect your

their diabetes differently. We’ve put together some tips to help, but talk to
* If you normally check blood sugars, keep a record of what happens when you’re being active and show this to your diabetes nurse or doctor. 
* If you’re at risk of hypos, keep hypo treatments handy. And a snack with some carbs in.
* Wear diabetes ID so people around you can help if they need to.
* If you use insulin to treat your diabetes, you might need to make changes to the dose you give around exercise.
