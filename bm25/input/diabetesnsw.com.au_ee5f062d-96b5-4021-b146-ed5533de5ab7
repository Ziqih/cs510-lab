# Exercise and why blood glucose levels go up
Regular exercise is a great way to manage blood glucose levels and provides
many other benefits to keep us healthy. Why do glucose levels sometimes rise
Exercise can help insulin work better, lower blood pressure and cholesterol
levels, reduce the risk of heart disease, decrease stress and also assists
with maintaining a healthy weight. The effect exercise has on your blood
glucose levels, however, will depend on the type, intensity and duration of
your chosen activity. Other variables might also include timing of medication
The general consensus is that exercise will lead to a reduction in blood
However, the short-term response can vary, particularly with high-intensity
exercise such as running, interval exercise or resistance training. With high-
intensity exercise, there is an increase in your heart rate and the fast-paced
movements cause the release of different hormones, including adrenaline. This
stimulates the release of glucose from places such as your liver to fuel this
As a result, you may see a short-term (over minutes to hours) increase in your
blood glucose levels, but the long-term outcome (over one to two days) will
bring about a sustained decrease in blood glucose levels. So, if you’ve ever
experienced an increase in your blood glucose levels shortly after this type
of exercise, don’t be alarmed, this is a normal response.
Alternatively, lower and moderate intensity exercise such as walking or
swimming will lead to both a short-term and long-term reduction in your blood
glucose levels, as this type of exercise utilises the excess glucose floating
around in the bloodstream. This type of exercise is more sustainable for most
people and forms part of the National Physical Activity Guidelines with the
goal of 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity on most days of the week.
## Become familiar with your BGLs and exercise
It’s important to become familiar with your blood glucose levels in response
When starting a new exercise, it’s a good idea to check blood glucose levels
before, during and after to see how your body reacts to different activities
and to help with planning for future exercise sessions. By understanding your
response to exercise, you can avoid adverse events such as hypoglycaemia
If your blood glucose level before exercise is over 15mmol/L, and it is
unexplained, check your blood ketone levels. Mild to moderate aerobic exercise
can be started if ketones are less than 0.6mmol/L. Intense exercise should be
avoided, however, and it’s recommended that blood glucose levels are checked
