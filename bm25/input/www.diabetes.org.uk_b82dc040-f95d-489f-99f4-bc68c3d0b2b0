## Why is regular exercise good for diabetes?
Exercise can have a positive impact on your diabetes management, as well as
your general wellbeing. Here are just a few of the benefits of doing regular
* Helps to lower blood pressure and bad cholesterol.
* Exercise can have a positive effect on your mood.
When we're looking at diabetes management, one of the most important benefits
of exercise is that it increases insulin sensitivity.
This means you'll need less insulin for the same amount of carbohydrate, and
it can also help bring down post-meal blood sugar spikes. You might be able to
see this effect after about 1 or 2 days after you've exercised. So, regular
aerobic activity is really important when you're managing your type 1
It can sometimes feel like a mental workout before you’ve even started
exercising because you have to decide if and how much you need to eat before
and during exercise. You also need to think about what to do with insulin
## The challenges of exercising and managing type 1 diabetes
* ### The risk of hypoglycaemia is high
When someone doesn't have type 1 diabetes, their body reduces the amount of
insulin they produce when they exercise. If you have type 1 diabetes, you
don't produce your own insulin, so if you don't adjust the amount you take,
your body will have the same amount of insulin in it when your exercise. This
means that your muscles use more glucose which can cause a hypo.
* ### Competitive sports can cause your blood sugar levels to increase.
Your blood sugar, or blood glucose levels, are affected by different hormones.
When you compete in exercises, like a football match, this can cause you to
become nervous and stressed. Stress releases a hormone that affects your blood
* ### Different types of exercise have different effects on your blood sugar.
There are three different types of exercise that can affect your blood sugar
1. Anaerobic exercise is high-intensity exercise over a short amount of time.
2. Aerobic exercise is lower-intensity exercise that you do over a longer amount of time.
3. 'Stop, start' is when you do aerobic exercise broken up by short spurts of high-intensity exercise.
Exercising when you have 'insulin on board' (IOB) – for example, when you
exercise soon after a meal and still have some rapid insulin in your system –
may result in a greater risk of hypoglycaemia and a greater need for
carbohydrate to offset the IOB. This variable means that doing the same
exercise, but at different times, can result in varying effects on blood
glucose. It’s essential to know how much IOB you have at the start of
Studies show that there is a large variation in how subjects respond to
exercise. What this means is that guidelines are very useful, as well as
learning from others, but remember that you’re an individual and your body may
Learn how different types of sports or training sessions affect your blood
glucose by testing before, during and after exercise, keeping a detailed
record to refer back to. Remember, you're an individual so don't be alarmed if
your blood glucose level behaves differently to what you expected.
If you're worried about having hypos when you exercise, you might end up with
high blood sugar levels as a result. We've created a table that you can use as
a guideline before and during exercise so you can get the most out of your
* Delay exercise until blood glucose is above 5mmol/L
* If no ketones, perform low-intensity exercise and/or give small correction dose of insulin
* If ketones less than 1.0mmol/L, consider small correction dose of insulin and perform low-intensity exercise and monitor blood glucose
* If ketones between 1–1.4mmol/L, take correction dose and exercise after 1 hour and monitor blood glucose
* If blood ketones above 1.5mmol/L, follow regular guidance received from diabetes team for treating ketones
Research has shown that you need to be in the range of 5–8 mmol/L to increase
performance during exercise. If you go low during exercise it will affect your
body which is an understandable worry. But exercising with high blood sugar
levels will also affect your body and lead to issues like dehydration,
A single blood sugar test doesn't help you figure out if your blood sugar
levels are going up or down. It's important before you exercise you take two
tests closely together so you know if your blood sugar levels are going up or
Exercising with your levels in the suggested ranges will allow your body to
burn more fat during exercise/ But be aware that if exercising with high blood
sugar levels, you need to drink more and keep hydrated.
Insulin on Board or IOB is the calculation that tells you how much insulin is
still active in your body. If you have low amounts of active insulin at the
start of exercise, it has some benefits that include being able to use more of
your fat stores during exercise, less risk of a hypo and less carbohydrate
needed during exercise to maintain your blood sugar levels.
When you're preparing for a training session, try to aim to have little IOB
during exercise, especially if you’re concerned about going low. This means
giving thought to the timing of meals and insulin boluses and also giving
All pumps will display your IOB which is only reflecting the bolus insulin and
If you take multiple daily injections, use an app which tracks active insulin
### Eating three hours before a training session
The action of most rapid-acting insulins is 3 to 4 hours, which means that an
insulin bolus taken three hours before a training session will have little
impact on the session. In this scenario, take your usual meal bolus and eat
Ideally, most of the carbohydrate in the meal should be minimally processed
and low glycaemic – examples of good choices include jumbo or steel-cut oats,
oat and nut muesli, root vegetables such as boiled potatoes or sweet potato,
whole grains such as quinoa, brown rice and bulgur wheat.
### Eating two hours before a training session
Eating two hours before the session is long enough to allow you to take your
usual insulin bolus, but at the same time is short enough so that you will
still have some IOB at the start of the session. Reducing your meal insulin
bolus at this time will likely result in higher post-meal blood sugar levels.
Consider having a low-glycaemic carbohydrate meal with a little carbohydrate.
This will mean that the insulin bolus is not too large, which means less IOB
during exercise. The meal should also have a small amount of fat, as too much
fat at this time can mean carbohydrates take longer to absorb.
In this scenario, you will have IOB when starting exercise and so you might
want to think about reducing your insulin basal rate (if using an insulin
pump) at least an hour before starting exercise.
### Eating 30 minutes before a training session
When you eat a meal containing carbohydrate very close to starting exercise,
you can greatly reduce the carbohydrate bolus. For example, take only a
quarter of your usual dose. You can also think about not taking the bolus if
the basal rate isn't reduced if blood glucose is below 7mmol/L, and the
exercise your doing is likely to lower your blood glucose. What you do here
will be largely influenced by what your blood sugar levels are at the time.
Total IOB determines how much fuel (carbohydrate) is required before and
during the session. This is in addition to other variables such as the
Everyone's diabetes is different so before making any adjustments to your
insulin doses, you should discuss any changes with your diabetes team.
The amount and type of insulin reduction depend on the timing, duration and
While a lot of emphasis gets put on carbohydrate, protein is important for
building muscle, adapting to training, recovering after training, weight loss
It’s worth having an idea of your protein needs and then using a calorie-
tracking app for a short period to make sure you're getting enough protein to
meet your fitness goals. You should try and get most of your protein from
food. Although there is a place for protein powders, you should use these if
it's difficult to eat food. Children and adolescents should avoid protein
If losing weight is your long-term goal, it's important to do so in a safe,
healthy way. If you'd prefer to stick to a set plan, it may be worth sitting
down with your diabetes team and creating one that will work for you.
