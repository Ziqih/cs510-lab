>>>>>>> Thanks to our research funding, scientists are busy investigating a
new weight management treatment, which includes a low-calorie diet, to help
people put their type 2 diabetes into remission.
>>>>>>> The ground-breaking study is called DiRECT, short for Diabetes
Remission Clinical Trial, and it could completely change the way type 2

results. Based on these results, the NHS in England and Scotland have begun to

trial and what it's like to be in type 2 diabetes remission.

healthier and fitter now. I have more energy and feel more able to do active
>>>>>>>> “When the trial team told me I had put my type 2 into remission, I
felt fantastic and it gave me that drive to make sure I maintained it.” Edward
>>>>>>> The first year results showed that it’s possible for some people to
put their type 2 diabetes into remission using a low-calorie, diet-based,
weight management programme, delivered by their GP. Almost half (45.6%) of
those who took part in the programme were in remission after a year.
>>>>>>> The second year results of the trial showed that, of these people, 70%
were still in remission by the end of year two.
>>>>>>> ### Overall, more than a third (36%) of people were in remission of
their type 2 diabetes two years after taking part in the programme.
>>>>>>> The second year results showed, again, that remission is closely
linked to weight loss. Two thirds (64%) of those who lost more than 10kg were
>>>>>>> As well as resulting in remission for some people, the second year
results showed us that there are extra benefits to taking part in a weight
management programme, including a reported better quality of life, improved
blood glucose (sugar) control, and a reduced need for diabetes medications.

needs to be a lifelong condition for everyone diagnosed with it.

>>>>>>> But what does remission actually mean? It’s when blood glucose (or
blood sugar) levels are below the diabetes range without the need for diabetes
medication. This doesn’t mean diabetes has gone for good. It’s still really
important for people in remission to get regular healthcare checks, so any
complications can be monitored and any signs of type 2 diabetes coming back
can be caught early. Find out more about remission.
>>>>>>> In this study, the team defined remission as keeping blood sugar
levels (HbA1c) below 6.5% (48mmol/mol) without the need to take any type 2
>>>>>>> Evidence suggests that the key to remission is weight loss.
>>>>>>>> “I was so pleased when I was told I was in remission. I thought it’s
all been worth it - going to the hospital, taking blood and doing all the
tests. When they showed me the scan of my liver and the difference in fat, I
was elated. Ironically, I wasn’t bothered about the outside, more about the
fat on the inside around the liver. It’s been a good journey!”
>>>>>>> Watch our animation about how remission works
>>>>>>> ## A bit of background on DiRECT
>>>>>>> We awarded our largest ever research grant of £2.5 million to help our
scientists find out if an intensive low-calorie, diet-based, weight management
programme can put type 2 diabetes into remission, and keep it there. The study
is also testing if this can be delivered entirely within the NHS.
>>>>>>> Professor Roy Taylor at Newcastle University and Professor Mike Lean
at the University of Glasgow are leading the study.
>>>>>>> Professors Roy Taylor (left) and Mike Lean (right)
>>>>>>> They’re building on the results of two previous smaller studies, which
gave us the first evidence that a low-calorie diet approach could put type 2
>>>>>>> These studies at Newcastle University tested 11 and 30 people with
type 2 diabetes. After eight weeks on the low-calorie diet, participants had
reduced the amount of fat in their liver and pancreas. This helped them
produce insulin again and put their type 2 diabetes into remission. Some
people were still in remission six months after the diet.
>>>>>>> An MRI scan of the liver - shows high levels of fat in green (left)
and a big decrease in fat after a low-calorie diet (right)
>>>>>>> Both of these studies were very small, happened in a research
environment and only followed participants for a short time. DiRECT was
designed to help us build on these findings and understand more about the
long-term effects of this programme – and how it could be used in a real-life
>>>>>>> Professors Roy Taylor and Mike Lean have recruited 306 participants
for the study, all from GP practices across Scotland and Tyneside. The people
taking part are aged between 25 and 65, and were diagnosed with type 2
diabetes within six years of starting the study. They are all overweight. We
know not everyone with type 2 diabetes is overweight, but weight gain and
obesity are the most important risk factors for type 2 diabetes.
>>>>>>> Half of the participants received the best type 2 diabetes care
available. The other took part in a weight management programme made up of
>>>>>>> First, they swapped their usual diet for low-calorie meal replacements
of 850 calories a day, made up of four soups or shakes. These have all the
>>>>>>> After the low-calorie diet, they were supported to gradually
reintroduce healthy food and maintain their weight loss in the long term.
>>>>>>> People getting the best care available were also supported to lose
weight, but were not on the low-calorie weight management programme.
>>>>>>> All of the people taking part have now been through the programme.
Now, their long-term progress is being followed up by the research team.
>>>>>>> The researchers will measure their metabolisms and fat levels inside
the body, to find out exactly how weight loss can put type 2 diabetes into
remission. They’re also carrying out psychological assessments with the
participants and healthcare professionals taking part in the study, to work
out how this approach might form part of routine GP care in the future.
>>>>>>> The low-calorie meal replacements used in DiRECT were around 850
calories a day. This is no quick fix, and we’re not recommending you try it
alone. Some people found the diet incredibly challenging. DiRECT was also
about much more than a low-calorie diet – people got expert support from
>>>>>>> Douglas Twenefour, our Deputy Head of Care, says speak to your GP
>>>>>>>> “If you’re thinking about trying a low-calorie diet, it’s really
important you speak to your GP and get referred to a dietitian. This is to
make sure you get tailored advice and support.
>>>>>>>> It’s also important to bear in mind that if you’re treating your type
2 diabetes with certain medications, such as insulin or sulphonylurea, a low-
calorie diet can make hypos more likely. So you’ll need support to make
changes to your medications and check your blood sugar levels more often.”
>>>>>>> Outside of DiRECT, we know that some people have put their type 2
diabetes into remission by losing weight in other ways, such as the
Mediterranean diet or a low-carb diet. We've got lots of meal plans you can
try, but it can be tricky to know where to begin. Use our tool to help you get
>>>>>>> It's fantastic news that, based on these results the NHS in England
and Scotland have begun to pilot low calorie diet programmes.
>>>>>>> Some participants are now being followed for another three years, and
the cost-effectiveness of the programme is being evaluated. We’re also funding
the ReTUNE trial, to see if a similar approach to remission could work in
>>>>>>> And there will still be more questions to answer after DiRECT.
>>>>>>> We need to fully understand how to help people to maintain their
weight loss in the long-term. And we want to find out how much type 2 diabetes
remission can protect people against diabetes-related complications later in
life. We also need to know who could benefit most from treatments like this in
the future, taking into account things like weight, ethnicity or how long

remission, so we can make remission a reality for as many people as possible.
