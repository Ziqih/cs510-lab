A growing number of researchers think that there is a relationship between
COVID-19 and diabetes. And the relationship between the coronavirus and

Italy, and New York City indicated that certain groups of people were more

As early as February, diabetes had emerged as one of the conditions associated
When four diabetes experts from Australia and the UK came together back in
April, they all mentioned something strange that they’d been seeing in their
hospitals. People were showing up in COVID-19 wards with lots of glucose in
their blood. These were people with no known history of diabetes.
This lead the group to reach out to others to see if they’d seen or heard of
Acute viral infections of all sorts can stress the body, causing blood sugar
levels to rise. So that in itself wasn’t unusual, says Francesco Rubino, a
bariatric surgeon and diabetes researcher at King’s College in London, one of
the original group. “What we were seeing and hearing was a little bit
Doctors around the world were describing strange situations in which COVID-19
patients were showing symptoms of diabetes that didn’t fit the typical
In most people with type 1 diabetes, their immune cells suddenly start
destroying the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin—the hormone that
allows glucose to exit the bloodstream and enter cells.
People with type 2 diabetes have a different problem; their body slowly
Rubino and his colleagues were seeing blended features of both types showing
up spontaneously in people who’d recently been diagnosed with COVID-19. “That
For clues to an explanation, Rubino and his colleagues looked to ACE2, the
protein receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to invade human cells. It appears in the
airways, yes, but also in other organs involved in controlling blood glucose,
including the gut. Doctors in China discovered copies of the coronavirus in
their COVID-19 patient’s feaces. And a meta-analysis found that
gastrointestinal symptoms affect one in 10 COVID-19 sufferers.
In the last few decades, scientists have discovered that the gut is not the
passive digestive organ once thought. It’s actually a major endocrine
player—responsible for producing hormone signals that talk to the pancreas,
telling it to make more insulin, and to the brain, ordering it to make its
If the coronavirus is messing with these signals, that could provide a
biological basis for why Covid-19 would be associated with different forms of
diabetes, including hybrid and previously unknown manifestations of the
Rubino is one of a growing number of researchers who think that the
relationship between the coronavirus and diabetes is actually a two-way
street. Having diabetes doesn’t just tip the odds toward contracting a worse
case of COVID-19. In some people, the virus might actually trigger the onset
of diabetes, and the potential for a lifetime of having to manage it.
Take for example, three men who showed up at a hospital in the northern part
of India weak, feverish, and without any history of diabetes. They all tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2. And when their bloodwork came back, they all had
dangerously high buildups of glucose and ketones, which the body produces when
it doesn’t have enough insulin to break down sugar. The official term for the
potentially deadly complication is diabeteic ketoacidosis, and it is usually
Mohammad Shafi Kuchay, an endocrinologist who consulted on the cases, said
that it was assumed the virus had knocked out the insulin-making cells, giving
the men type 1 diabetes. So they were put on a regimen of insulin injections.
But as the months went by, they needed the injections less and less. They were
shifted to oral diabetes medication and have been managing like this for more
“That means the patients have type 2 diabetes,” said Shafi Kuchay
Whatever damage the virus caused to these patients’ insulin-secreting cells
appears to be transient. More monitoring will be necessary to determine if
their type 2 diabetes diagnosis is short-lived, as well.
Will other patients also find that their blood glucose problems go away when
their infection resolves? Or will COVID-19 cause diabetes for life?
“None of those questions could be addressed with just the anecdotal case
reports that were coming out,” says Rubino. That’s why he and an international
group of scientists decided to act on their hunch and establish a global
repository for tracking information about the coronavirus-related diabetes.
 _The CoviDiab Registry_ allows doctors around the world to upload anonymized
data about Covid-19 patients with abnormal blood glucose levels who have no
prior history of diabetes. That includes the basics, like age, sex, past
medical history, and details of the person’s disease progression: Do they wind
up in the ICU or on a ventilator? But the registry also asks doctors to
catalogue which medications they’re administering, on the off chance that it’s
not the coronavirus infection that’s triggering the diabetes but an unknown
side effect of something used to treat it.
The goal of this information-gathering effort is to understand the scale and
scope of the problem, as well as potential solutions.
How often is COVID-19 associated with new-onset diabetes? Whether type 1, type
2, or a new form of the condition? What exactly causes the metabolic
malfunction? How long do such cases of diabetes last, and what are the best
It might be a while before there’s enough data to answer questions about
prevalence and mechanism. But Rubino thinks they could have information about
what kinds of diabetes most frequently develop in Covid-19 patients—and what
might predispose people to this particular coronavirus complication—by the end
The diabetes database launched in June, and since then, more than 275
physicians have requested access to share data about at least one patient who
meets the criteria. Vetting each physician contributor takes time, and after
that, registry organizers have to set up data-sharing agreements that comply
with Europe’s strict data protection laws. But so far, dozens of cases have
And what’s clear, says Rubino, is that this is not just an anecdotal problem.
“From what we’ve seen so far, COVID-19-related diabetes will not be a
prevalent issue that affects the majority of people,” he says. “But now we
know it’s a possibility, even if not a common one.”
That’s important for people to know, because diabetes can be easily managed,
as long as it’s diagnosed. Be aware, not alarmed, says Rubino. If you’ve
recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 and notice that you’re having to pee
more often than usual, or are continuing to feel fatigued after you’ve
recovered from other symptoms like fever, coughing, and loss of smell, that
could be a good reason to ask your doctor about getting a blood test.
Provided they find funding to keep it going, Rubino and his colleagues hope to
keep the registry running for years. That would allow them to investigate
whether COVID-associated diabetes is a fleeting condition that passes when the
infection clears or a long-term diagnosis. It could also capture situations in
which the infection doesn’t cause diabetes immediately, but causes enough
damage to tissues involved in metabolism that it heightens a person’s risk of
developing the disease later. “We’re looking at a possible legacy effect of
COVID-19,” says Rubino. “With the registry we hope to be able to look into the
