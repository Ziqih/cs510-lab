I was diagnosed two weeks after turning 21 after suffering constant thirst &
urination, especially at night, whist studying for my final year exams in the
Bachelor of Business Degree, majoring in Accountancy, at UTS. I was
hospitalised at Concord hospital for one week. At the time, it could not be
determined if I was Type 1 or Type 2.
I was put onto tablets. That lasted for six months - which I call my
“honeymoon period” and ended while I was on a Contiki holiday in Central
Australia. I came back to Sydney weighing 60kgs, all skin and bones! The
diabetes clinic at RPAH put me onto insulin injections. Within a month I had
put on weight and looked a lot healthier.
During the early years, I suffered from many hypos, especially unconscious
ones whilst sleeping at night, which was very scary. To be frank, I could
write a book about the number of hypos I have suffered in a variety of
different places and situations over time! However, with a reduction in the
amount of insulin and the introduction of basal long acting insulin, the hypos
reduced. However, over the many years my diabetic control has been excellent
with my HbA1C being consistently in the 7 range.
To date, I have no complications, which is great after 28 years. As someone
who loves exercising from lap swimming, walking and doing gym classes such as
HIIT, boxing and cycle classes, together with eating wisely, this has helped
immensely with my day to day diabetic management.
Diabetes has not hindered my career. I am a Chartered Accountant and Director
of Client Services in the Business Advisory Division at mid-tier firm, Nexia
My biggest day to day challenge is hypoglycaemia unawareness. My diabetic
specialists at RPAH, Professor Stephen Twigg and Professor Margaret McGill,
have been recommending for some time, that I change my diabetic management. As
a result, over the past few months, I have started using a Continuous Glucose
Monitoring (CGM) device known as Guardian Connect. The piercing alert tone
from my mobile phone, well before my sugars go too low, has been a saviour for
me in reducing severe hypoglycaemic events. The device illustrates how
technology is making improvements to the quality of my life. This, together
with my determined mind set in keeping diabetes in check, allows me to live a
