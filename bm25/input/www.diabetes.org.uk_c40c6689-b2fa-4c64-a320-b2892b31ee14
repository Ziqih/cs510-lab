>>>>>>> ### 1934 – Diabetes UK was founded to improve access to insulin
>>>>>>> In 1921, Sir Frederick Banting, along with scientists Charles Best,
John Macleod and James Collip, first discovered insulin. Then in 1934 the
Diabetic Association was set up by novelist HG Wells and Doctor RD Lawrence –
both of whom had type 1 diabetes. RD Lawrence’s life had been saved by the
discovery of insulin and their mission was to ensure that everyone with
diabetes in the UK had access to this breakthrough treatment, whatever their
>>>>>>> ### 1935 – We awarded our first research grant
>>>>>>> Dr Kosterlitz was awarded the first Diabetic Association (our name
before Diabetes UK) research grant of £50, to work with Professor John
Macleod, one of the scientists who discovered insulin. In 1939, Dr Kosterlitz
made a major discovery in how the liver produces glucose.
>>>>>>> ### 1962 – The Bedford Survey begins
>>>>>>> Professor Harry Keen and his team at Guy’s Hospital Medical School
defined the characteristics of Type 2 diabetes and developed the term
‘borderline diabetes’ to describe people at very high risk of the condition.
They surveyed 24,000 people in Bedford and tested their urine samples, finding
>>>>>>> 1977 – We bought the UK’s first artificial pancreas
>>>>>>> The UK's first artificial pancreas cost £22,000 and was the size of a
filing cabinet. Professor Sir George Alberti used this to help stabilise blood
glucose levels in people with Type 1 diabetes. His work earned him the
>>>>>>> Then in 2016, we funded more research into the artificial pancreas in
pregnant women where Professor Helen Murphy showed that the artificial
pancreas is able to help pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes to manage their
blood glucose, within the home setting. 16 women used the device for a month,
and 14 of them chose to continue using the artificial pancreas for the rest of
>>>>>>> This research changed Laura's life (pictured here with her son).
>>>>>>> ### 1977 – UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) begins
>>>>>>> The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was a landmark 20 year
clinical trial involving 5,000 people with Type 2 diabetes.
>The results showed that controlling blood glucose and blood pressure
> drastically reduces the risk of complications in people with Type 2
> diabetes. This research changed treatment and care for people all over the

>>>>>>> ### 1978 – The first insulin pump is tested
>>>>>>> Professors John Pickup, Harry Keen, John Parsons and Sir George
Alberti tested the first insulin pump at Guy's Hospital Medical School,
>>>>>>> 1981 – The UK’s first Diabetic Foot Clinic
>>>>>>> Working with King’s College Hospital, we helped establish the UK’s
first Diabetic Foot Clinic. Set up by Dr Michael Edmonds and Dr Peter Watkins,
this specialised clinic brought together the skills of chiropodists, shoe-
fitters, nurses, diabetes doctors and surgeons, all for people with diabetes
who had foot problems, for the first time.
>>>>>>> After three years, the number of major amputations had halved. We’re
continuing to support footcare research at the clinic today.
>>>>>>> Find out more about our research into diabetes and feet.
>>>>>>> ### 1983 – The first insulin pen is tested
>>>>>>> Back in the 1970s, injecting insulin involved glass syringes and steel
needles that had to be sharpened and reused. Dr Sheila Reith teamed up with Dr
John Ireland and Dr John Paton to design a new device to make injections
easier. They developed the first insulin pen prototype - a device which could
inject with a single push of a button. By 1983, with a few design tweaks, the
world's first insulin pen - Penject - was available.
>>>>>>> This research changed lives, including Peter's - who was diagnosed
with Type 1 diabetes when he was just two years old. Find out how Peter has
seen technology advance over the years, thanks to research like ours.
>>>>>>> ### 1985 –The Oxford Regional Prospective Study of Diabetes (ORPS)
>>>>>>> The Oxford Regional Prospective Study of Diabetes (ORPS) tracked the
health of over 500 children with Type 1 diabetes straight after diagnosis. 17%
of the children had protein in their urine, which was associated with a higher
risk of cardiovascular and kidney complications early on in life. ORPS helped
researchers to find those at high risk of kidney disease, so they could try to
>>>>>>> 1986 – Screening for retinopathy (eye damage due to diabetes)
>>>>>>> Professor Roy Taylor (pictured here) was shocked by the number of
people with sight loss in Newcastle. He decided to see if a mobile retinal
camera could screen people with diabetes for retinopathy (eye disease). The
team mounted their camera in the back of a second-hand ambulance, which they
>>>>>>> This pioneering study showed that this type of screening was more
reliable than the standard practice at the time, and by making the service
mobile, more people could be screened. Thanks to this research, Newcastle
became the first city in the UK where diabetes was no longer the leading cause
of sight loss in the working age population in 2009.
>>>>>>> Find out more about our retinopathy research.
>>>>>>> ### 1987 – The first digital glucose meter
>>>>>>> Professor Anthony Turner and his team at Cranfield University
developed a new kind of digital glucose meter that was simpler, cheaper and
more effective than existing devices. This led to the launch of ExacTech,
which is considered the great-grandfather of most glucose meters on the market
>>>>>>> ### 1989 – The Type 1 diabetes Warren Collection
>>>>>>> The Warren Collections were set up when Alec and Beryl Warren left a
gift to Diabetes UK in their will. The collections of biological samples from
people with a family history of Type 1 diabetes help to link different genes
to the condition. As a result, the first genes related to Type 1 diabetes were
>>>>>>> ### 1996 – The Type 2 diabetes Warren Collection
>>>>>>> The Type 2 diabetes Warren Collection was formed, involving six UK
research centres and 2,000 people with one or more family member with Type 2
diabetes. Scientists quickly found genes that increase the risk of Type 2
diabetes in people with a family history of the condition, which demonstrated
the need to reduce the risk in family members of those with Type 2 diabetes.
Since then, a number of genes associated with Type 2 diabetes have been found
>>>>>>> Professors Stephanie Amiel and Simon Heller and Dr Sue Roberts began
to design a programme called Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating (DAFNE). DAFNE
is an education programme that helps people with Type 1 diabetes have the
freedom to eat what they like, and adjust their insulin doses to match.
Results showed that DAFNE significantly improved blood glucose control. Over
40,000 people with Type 1 diabetes have benefitted from a DAFNE course since
then, resulting in fewer hypos, fewer hypers and a better quality of life.
>>>>>>> We launched a campaign to raise funds for an Islet Transplant
Consortium, to ensure that islet transplantation would become available in the
>>>>>>> The Consortium brought together nine islet research centres from
around the country, leading to the first islet transplant in the UK at King's
>>>>>>> Thanks to this research, islet transplants became available on the NHS
by 2008, helping people like Bruce (pictured here) produce their own insulin.
>>>>>>> Find out more about this incredible research into islet transplants.
>>>>>>> ### 2003 – CARDS trial stopped two years early due to success
>>>>>>> The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) changed the way
cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, were used. Not just across the NHS, but
across the world. CARDS was the first ever clinical trial in almost 3,000
people designed to understand if statins could reduce the risk of heart attack
and stroke in people with Type 2 diabetes. Heart attacks were reduced by over
a third and stroke by just under half. The findings were so good that in 2003,
it was decided that everyone on the trial would benefit from taking the
>>>>>>> 2004 – Scientists discover cause of neonatal diabetes
>>>>>>> Professor Andrew Hattersley and his team at the University of Exeter
showed that a rare form of diabetes, called neonatal diabetes, was caused by a
genetic change in a single gene. This genetic change stopped the pancreas from
>>>>>>> They went on to show that people with this form of neonatal diabetes
could switch from insulin injections to sulphonylurea tablets. This gave them
better blood glucose control and fewer hypos. As a result of becoming experts
in rare forms diabetes, the research group have had referrals from nearly 60

>>>>>>> ### 2011 – A step forward in making the artificial pancreas a reality
>>>>>>> We funded Professor Roman Hovorka to perform a world-first trial into
using the artificial pancreas out of the lab environment, and in people’s
everyday lives. The artificial pancreas helped 24 people with Type 1 diabetes
keep their blood glucose levels in range for longer.
>>>>>>> ### 2013 – International experts on immunotherapy brought together
>>>>>>> The Type 1 Diabetes UK Immunotherapy Consortium (T1DUK) was set up
with a £2.8 million investment, in partnership with Tesco and JDRF. T1DUK is
bringing together world-class researchers across UK to develop and test new
Type 1 diabetes immunotherapies, speeding up the development of treatments to

>>>>>>> Following from advances in the artificial pancreas back in 2011,
Professor Helen Murphy showed that the artificial pancreas is able to help
pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes to manage their blood glucose, within the
home setting. 16 women used the device for a month, and 14 of them chose to
continue using the artificial pancreas for the rest of their pregnancy and

>>>>>>> 2017 – DiRECT study on Type 2 remission, the first year results
>>>>>>> We awarded our largest-ever research grant of £2.5 million to
Professors Roy Taylor and Mike Lean, who joined forces to run the Diabetes
Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT). The first year results showed that it’s
possible for some people to put their Type 2 diabetes into remission using a
low-calorie, diet-based, weight management programme, delivered by their GP.
Almost half (45.6 per cent) of those who took part in the programme were in
remission after a year. The researchers are now investigating whether
remission can be maintained in the long term, and whether the programme is
