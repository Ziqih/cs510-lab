Diabulimia is an eating disorder that only affects people with Type 1
diabetes. It’s when someone reduces or stops taking their insulin to lose
weight. But when you have Type 1 diabetes, you need insulin to live. So
Diabulimia isn’t actually a real medical term, but it’s what people tend to
You may know that stopping taking insulin can make you lose weight. But you
may not know what it’s called or that it’s an eating disorder. Friends and
family members probably won’t have heard of it either. But diabulimia is
serious and more common than people think. And like all eating disorders, it
can affect both men and women. We've got lots more information about eating

Like any eating disorder, this can be a tough subject to talk about. There are
lots of reasons why diabulimia might develop too. But we’re here to explain
all the facts, how it can be treated and where to get help if you need it. And

Diabulimia is serious. But it’s not a recognised mental illness in its own
right. And because it isn’t widely understood, some healthcare professionals
may not spot the signs or know how to support someone with it.
It can be frustrating if you can’t speak to someone who understands both the
physical and emotional aspects of diabetes. But healthcare teams are getting
better at joining up services so you’re able to get help with your mental
And it’s important to know that when you have diabetes, you’re entitled to
emotional and psychological support as one of your 15 health checks. This is

There are lots of reasons diabulimia may develop. It’s often not just down to
one thing – it might be a combination of physical, social and mental health
problems. When you have Type 1, the things you need to do to manage it can
play a part in setting off diabulimia, like:
* the focus on your weight when you go to the clinic
* having to eat to treat hypos, which can cause weight gain and guilt 
* being constantly aware of carbohydrates or calories in food
* feeling shame over how you manage your diabetes
* a bad relationship with your healthcare team
The term diabulimia may not be well known – but it is a serious problem.
But we don’t know exactly how many people are living with it. It’s estimated
around 4 out of 10 women, aged 15 to 30, take less insulin to lose weight. And
for young men, it’s around 1 out of 10. Research shows men with diabetes are
more worried about their weight than men who don’t have diabetes.
When you’re diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, you’ve generally lost weight.
Starting insulin can mean you put that weight back on. Some people can find
this hard to deal with and this can be one of the reasons they start to skip
Without insulin, your blood sugar levels build up really quickly. This is
known as hyperglycaemia (or hyper) and you start going to the toilet a lot.
Any calories you’re taking in pass straight through and out of the body in
This means you can’t get the energy you need from food and you start to break
down body fat instead. This leads to dramatic weight loss.
If you don’t get any or enough insulin, your blood sugar levels won’t come
down. This is very dangerous and it can send you into diabetic ketoacidosis
And if you regularly stop taking insulin for a long time, you will harm your
body. You could lose your sight, damage your kidneys and damage the nerves in
your feet. These are called diabetes complications. They can happen because
high blood sugar levels are damaging your blood vessels.
It can be difficult to break out of the harmful cycle of not taking your
insulin. But with the right help and support, you can recover from diabulimia.
Diabetes teams, GPs and eating disorder specialists are becoming more aware of
diabulimia. Diabulimia needs careful treatment from a team of specialists. And
some dedicated recovery programmes are now up and running in the UK. So you
could be referred to an eating disorder clinic or a counsellor for specialist
The first step to recovery is asking for help. Hear from Lynsey on how she
