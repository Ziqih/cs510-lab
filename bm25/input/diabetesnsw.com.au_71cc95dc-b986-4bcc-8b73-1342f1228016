Managing blood glucose levels is just one of many key reasons to exercise. But
what if you have type 1 diabetes, your levels are erratic and you want to get
The benefits of exercise far outweigh the risks, however it is important
understand how your levels respond to different types of exercise to reduce
your risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. As the name suggests, the recent
invention of the **Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)** can be of great
assistance in this instance. CGM is a blood glucose sensor, which is attached
to a site on the stomach allows for 24 hour feedback of blood glucose levels
to a transmitter. This allows the user to see what their level is at that
moment in time, and information on which way their blood glucose level is
trending (up or down). It does require daily calibration with two finger prick
tests, but this can be considered a blessing if you usually have to prick your
Last year, one of our BEAT IT participants living with type 1 diabetes was
able to trial a CGM for a week. Lori, a 54 year old female with type 1
diabetes had joined the BEAT IT program hoping to get some more skills around
how to exercise and to improve her HbA1c. She had been managing the condition
for 48 years, so essentially her whole life! As a result of diabetes, Lori has
some long term complications including peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy
“I can’t read print, so I use a computer that talks to me, and I can’t see
enough to get around without using a white cane”.
Lori was no stranger to physical activity. She spent many years training in
Japanese martial arts, walks regularly and kayaks on the ocean a few times a
“I like challenging myself, especially through developing new skills in
Lori’s blood glucose levels were constantly fluctuating, with no clear pattern
detected from finger prick tests. She was not getting the full picture. With
the help of Rebecca from Animas, Lori trialled the DEXCOM 4 CGM for seven
“It was really valuable. It gave a really clear picture of what my blood
glucose levels were doing over the 24 hours. It was great to be able to look
at the receiver and see what my levels were at any given time. For example, if
I was in a meeting and I was hungry, was I hungry because my level was low or
was I just hungry? It was also great because I didn’t need to do so many
With regards to diabetes management, the CGM was able to help Lori’s diabetes
team to understand medication adjustments that needed to be made. In this
instance, “I was able to increase insulin basal rates, which has improved my
levels through the day”. By the end of the 8 week BEAT IT program, Lori’s
HbA1c dropped from 10.2% to 8.6%. She also reduced her weight by 1.2kg and
The downside to the CGM? “Having to still do two finger prick tests to
calibrate the device daily, but that’s hardly anything to complain about”
