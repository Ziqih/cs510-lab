... DNA misfolding linked to risk of Type 1
# DNA misfolding linked to risk of Type 1
Genetics, is a major factor when it comes to the risk of developing autoimmune
In human cells, a person's genome - about six feet of DNA - is compressed
inside the nucleus via a three-dimensional folding process. Specialized
proteins decode the genetic information, reading instruction from our genome
In a world first study, researchers at Penn Medicine decided to look at what
would happen if there was a variation in the sequence affecting the folding
pattern in the nucleus and whether it would make people more susceptible to
What they’ve found, in mice, is that changes in DNA sequence can trigger the
chromosomes to misfold in a way that puts one at a heightened risk for Type 1
The study, published in Immunity, revealed that differences in DNA sequences
dramatically changed how the DNA folded inside the nucleus, ultimately
affecting the regulation-the induction or repression-of genes linked to the
While we know that people who inherit certain genes have a heightened risk of
developing Type 1 diabetes, there has been little information about the
underlying molecular factors that contribute to the link between genetics and
This research, demonstrates how DNA misfolding-caused by sequence variation-
contributes to the development of Type 1 diabetes. With this deeper
understanding, it’s hoped it will be possible to reverse DNA misfolding and
Autoimmune conditions, which affect millions of people worldwide, and occur
when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy organs, tissues and
cells. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases, including
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and Type 1 diabetes.
In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops producing insulin, the hormone that
controls blood glucose levels. White blood cells called T lymphocytes play a
significant role in the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta
Until now, little has been known about the extent to which sequence variation
could cause unusual chromatin folding and, ultimately, affect gene expression.
In this study, Penn Medicine researchers generated ultra-high resolution
genomic maps to measure the three-dimensional DNA folding in T lymphocytes in
two strains of mice: a diabetes-susceptible and diabetes-resistant mouse
strain. The two strains of mice have six million differences in their genomic
DNA, which is similar to the number of differences in the genetic code between
The Penn team, found that previously defined insulin-diabetes associated
regions were also the most hyperfolded regions in the T cells of mice with
diabetes. Researchers then used a high-resolution imaging technique to
corroborate the genome misfolding in diabetes-susceptible mice. Importantly,
they found the change in folding patterns occurred before the mouse developed
the condition. Researchers suggest that the observation could serve as a
diagnostic tool in the future if investigators are able to identify such
hyperfolded regions in the T cells of humans.
While much more work is needed, the findings are pushing the team closer to a
more mechanistic understanding of the link between genetics and autoimmune
conditions. An important step in identifying factors that influence the risk
