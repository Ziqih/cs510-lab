For people with chronic health conditions, like diabetes, it’s essential that
they continue to look after their health. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic
its important to seek routine medical care and take action in an emergency.
Delaying or avoiding necessary medical care could lead to serious health

patients are presenting to emergency departments and primary care services in
This might be because people are fearful of catching coronavirus, or it may be

health professionals about how regular appointments will be conducted.
To minimise risks to staff and patients, many health services are offering
telehealth appointments (via phone or video conference). It’s best to contact
your GP or specialist by phone prior to your appointment to see whether this
