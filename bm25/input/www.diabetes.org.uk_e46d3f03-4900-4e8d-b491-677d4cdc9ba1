An authentic risotto with lots of mushrooms, onions and garlic that’s much
Please view Whisk.com privacy policy for more information
900ml vegetable stock (1 low-salt stock cube dissolved in 900ml water)
2 tbsp basil, roughly chopped (or 2 tsp dried)
1. Add the oil to a saucepan and fry the onions and chilli for 5 minutes, until starting to brown.
2. In a separate pan, heat the stock and leave it simmering very gently.
3. Add the garlic, a pinch of pepper and the mushrooms to the onion, stir for 1 minute and add the rice. Stir for 2 minutes, then add two ladles of stock, enough to just cover the rice and stir again.
4. Regularly stirring the rice, add the hot stock, a little at a time, so the rice is just covered. The risotto should be very gently bubbling.
5. After 15 minutes, add the basil, stir for another 2-5 minutes, testing the rice to make sure it’s cooked ‘al dente’ (slightly firm) and adding any remaining stock.
6. Finally, add the yogurt. Beat vigorously for 1 minute with a wooden spoon, cover and allow to stand 2 minutes. Sprinkle with basil and black pepper before serving.
* Beating the risotto with a wooden spoon helps plump up the rice and makes the risotto more creamy.
* Freezing instructions: Suitable for freezing once cooked. Chill quickly. Defrost in the fridge and reheat thoroughly until piping hot throughout. Eat immediately and discard any leftovers.
