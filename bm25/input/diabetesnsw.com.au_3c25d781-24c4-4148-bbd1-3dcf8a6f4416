# Exercise boosts gut health to build muscles and endurance
Regular exercise changes the composition of the gut bacteria and may play a
crucial role in skeletal muscle function and endurance.
The recently published review of the top studies published in exercise
metabolism conducted by John Hawley, Director of Australian Catholic
University’s Mary Mackillop Institute for Health Research, uncovered
biologically important links between skeletal muscle and the gut microbiome.
The review reveals how regular exercise enhances gut health independent of
diet and plays important roles in whole-body health.
The gut microbiome comprises the trillions of bacteria, fungi, viruses and
other microbes and is now thought to impact many other organ systems and
tissues in the body, including your brain and muscles, with poor bacterial
diversity linked to several chronic metabolic disorders including obesity,
Now, research is pointing to new and even more wide-ranging benefits of
regular exercise – linking higher levels of exercise to a gut bacterial
“These studies provide new insight into the biological crosstalk between the
gut microbiota and skeletal muscle,” Professor Hawley said.
“Muscle crosstalk with other organs and tissues, including the liver, bone and
brain, offers a framework for understanding how exercise transmits many of its
Professor Hawley said while emerging research confirms the microbiome’s
positive role in gut health, it is now clear exercise – regardless of the diet
– plays a vital role in changing the gut microbiota.
“Exercise is a powerful intervention to change the microbiota composition to
restore gut symbiosis by reversing an imbalance in bacteria,” Professor Hawley
He said while taking up exercise will boost gut health, research shows
Improved metabolic health and exercise performance in athletes is also
associated with increased microbial diversity and abundance of bacterial
“While there is a lot more research to be done to uncover the precise
mechanisms linking the intestinal microbiota, fuel stores and skeletal muscle
function, it is already clear that the highway between the gut and skeletal
