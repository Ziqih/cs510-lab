Your health needs to be a priority! Diabetes is like a silent killer and it
can have a vicious cycle of losing control, then feeling depressed which in
I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in August 2003 – I was 13 years old and
at first I had no response: I didn’t care about the severity of the disease
and often ignored the fact I had a chronic illness. I was invincible!
By the time I was 15, I put on 20kg which resulted in serious body image
issues and an eating disorder. I stopped injecting insulin in an attempt to
control and lose weight. I ended up with severe depression. I hated life. All
I could see was what other teenagers had that I didn’t.
When I was 17 I met my endocrinologist who helped me to understand and manage
my diabetes. As I developed my understanding, I got an opportunity to work for
Diabetes NSW and it has turned my life around.
Cooking has always been a passion of mine – particularly cakes. I love the
decorating side – so while I continue working at Diabetes NSW, I have also
opened my business: All Caked Up. If people are shocked by my passion, I ask
if I would do it without diabetes, why shouldn’t I do it with diabetes? My
support network has helped me be who I am today and to live my life – my way –
and I want to encourage others to feel the same.
