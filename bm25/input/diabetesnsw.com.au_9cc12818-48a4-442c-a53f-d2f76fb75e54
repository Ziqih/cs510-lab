# Discovery could change treatments for type 2 diabetes
Today, many health problems appear to stem from the disruption the metabolic
balance between glucose production and energy utilization in the liver. Now,
Yale scientists have reported (in JAMA surgery) the discovery of the molecular
mechanisms that trigger the imbalance between these two processes.
A finding with implications for future treatments of type 2 diabetes and non-
The hormone glucagon, secreted by the pancreas, plays an essential role in our
metabolism. In times of food scarcity, it can jump-start the liver's
production of glucose, an essential fuel for the brain, in a process called
gluconeogenesis. In diabetes, which is marked by an excess of blood glucose,
By applying novel methods to assess liver metabolism they have been able to
delineate the molecular mechanisms by which glucagon works.
In the past, researchers have previously focused on glucagon in attempts to
reduce elevated blood glucose in diabetes. But those experimental treatments
led to potentially serious side effects, including a build-up of liver enzymes
The new research zeroed in on the role of calcium signalling within the
The Yale team led by two senior endocrinologists discovered that a protein
called inositol triphosphate receptor 1 (INSP3R1) regulates both
gluconeogenesis and fat oxidation in the liver in response to glucagon. The
group found that INSP3R1 influences gluconeogenesis by regulating calcium
signalling within the cell and fat oxidation by influencing calcium signalling
They identified mitochondrial calcium transport as a potential target to
promote the good effects of glucagon to promote mitochondrial fat oxidation in
the liver and reverse NAFLD without the bad effects of stimulating
When obese rodents were treated chronically with glucagon, the hormone
reversed NAFLD and improved the body's response to insulin. However, when
obese mice without INSP3R1 were chronically treated with glucagon, the hormone
These results provide new insights into glucagon biology and suggest that
mitochondrial calcium transport, mediated by INSP3R1, may represent a novel
target for treatments that aim to reverse NAFLD and type 2 diabetes.
