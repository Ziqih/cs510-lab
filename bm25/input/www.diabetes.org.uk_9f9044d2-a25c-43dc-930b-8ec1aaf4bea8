has helped us transform the lives of millions of people living with diabetes
>>>>>>> But there’s still so much we need to do for a world where diabetes can
do no harm. You can help us get there by supporting our life-changing
>>>>>>> At any one time, we have around 120 research projects making
discoveries across the UK. Found a research project you could really get
behind? If you raise £1,000 or more, you could adopt it. This gives you the
chance to get even closer to the research we fund.
>>>>>>> Your donation will go directly to the project you choose – from
tackling a complication of diabetes to bringing us one step closer to a cure.
>>>>>>> Mo and her partner David have cycled the length of the UK on a tandem
and taken part in several climbs, including the Three Peaks Challenge, to
raise funds for us. They donated £10,000 to fund our research into eye damage

>>>>>>> ### Volunteer to be in a research study
>>>>>>> Diabetes research can’t happen without your help. Scientists need your
help to test new treatments and learn more about diabetes.
>>>>>>> Volunteer to take part in a research study. Whether it’s a clinical
trial, an interview or a questionnaire – research breakthroughs can only
happen with your support. Find an opportunity you want to get involved with.
>>>>>>>> “I think it’s really important for people to volunteer and take part
in research because studies sometimes fail from lack of participant. Yes it’s
time-consuming, but it’s hugely rewarding and I’d really highly recommend it
to anybody. It’s a good motivator, it helps you to look after yourself better,
just by taking part in a single study, so do it!”
>>>>>>> ### Tell us what you want us to research
>>>>>>> We want to give people with diabetes a louder voice in research.
That’s why they’re involved in our research funding decisions and our work to
find the biggest research priorities for the future.
>>>>>>> Make sure diabetes research is relevant to people living with the
condition by joining our Grants Advisory Panel or one of our Clinical Studies
>>>>>>>> “I wanted to get involved in Diabetes UK’s Grants Advisory Panel
because I’m passionate about research that will make a difference to people
living with diabetes. It’s a great opportunity to share ideas, meet like-
minded people, and have your voice heard by diabetes experts as well as
keeping up to date with the latest ideas – prevention, management and
potential cures. The professionals really do listen to us ‘lay’ people!"
