## How can diabetes affect a student’s learning?
Diabetes can affect a child’s learning because it can cause difficulties with
attention, memory, processing speed and perceptual skills if it’s not managed.
It’s really important that a child is supported at school so they can manage
their diabetes and get the most out of being at school.
Some children with diabetes will have more absences than other students. This
won’t be the case for every child with diabetes, but if they do take time off
for hospital appointments or feeling unwell because of diabetes, it’s
important they don’t get penalised for this if possible.
It’s the parent’s responsibility to tell you their child has diabetes as soon
as possible, so make sure you discuss your school’s absence policy with them
and how you can be flexible to make sure the child doesn’t feel set up to

All schools should have these basic procedures in place to support students
with a long-term medical condition, such as diabetes.
Medical conditions policies are created by the local authority and the
school’s board of governors and should be review regularly. They cover what
actions should be taken by the school to make sure a child is looked after,
and that they are fully included in the day-to-day life of the school. In
England, every school must have a medical conditions policy.
If your school is in Wales, you must have a healthcare needs policy in place,
which your local authority and governors should create and maintain.
In Scotland, education authorities and NHS boards should work together to
create and agree on a policy framework to support children in their local
area’s schools. Getting it Right for Every Child is the national approach in
Scotland that aims to improve the care of students with medical conditions.
Individual Health Care Plans, or IHPs, are called different things depending
on the nation your school is in. But these plans are used to make sure a
