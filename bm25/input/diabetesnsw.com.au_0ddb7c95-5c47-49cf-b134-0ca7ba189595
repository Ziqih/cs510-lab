White rice and jasmine rice can both cause a quick rise in your blood glucose
levels. Accredited Practising Dietitian Lexie Jin suggests ways to modify some
traditional chinese dishes to help you with blood glucose management.
Congees are a popular year-round breakfast option. However, they can cause a
quick rise in your blood glucose levels (BGL) because they are high in
Glycaemic Index (GI) as they are made with white rice.
Swap or mix your white rice with grains such as pearl barley, red beans, mung
beans and rolled oats. These have a lower GI and work well in congee. They add
some extra protein and fibre to your meal too which helps you to feel full for
longer. You don’t have to replace your white rice completely with grains,
instead mix them to find your own balance.
The Glycaemic Index (GI) rates how quickly a carbohydrate containing food is
broken down into glucose after being eaten. Higher GI foods produces a faster
and higher rise in blood sugar levels (BGL), whereas lower GI foods produce a
Adding some extra lower GI beans and grains helps with lowering the GI of your
congee without altering the taste and texture too much. If you don’t like
grains, try adding animal proteins such as lean chicken, pork and some
Just like congees, white jasmine rice is high in GI. Swap it with low GI rice
such as Doongara or Basmati rice. If giving up your favourite rice could is
the last thing you want to do, consider mixing your regular jasmine rice with
low GI rice, or adding some other lower GI grains like quinoa or black rice.
You are lucky if you enjoy noodles because most noodles are lower in GI,
including instant noodles. However, even though instant noodles are lower GI
they are high in saturated fat and sodium so they must be limited. Foods that
are high in saturated fat and sodium can increase your risk of developing
It is best to choose low GI alternatives such as egg noodles, rice noodles or
When it comes to stir-fries or stews, it’s easy to forget about the hidden
sources of carbohydrates such as the sweet marinate sauce for Cha Siu or the
corn starch used to coat the meat - they all add up and contribute to higher
BGLs after meals. Only use a minimal amount of marinades, sugar, syrup or corn
Dishes prepared with pork ribs, chicken wings and pork belly will not have the
most direct and immediate effect on your BGL as they are not high in
carbohydrate. However, fatty portions on the meat and skins on the chicken are
high in saturated fat. Saturated fats not only increase your cholesterol
level, but make your insulin work less effectively, which will have a negative
influence on your long term BGLs and weight management. Make sure you are trim
the fatty portions of the meat off and remove the skins from the chicken
before cooking. Additionally, add some colourful vegetables to your stir
fries/stews or have an extra vegetable based dish to add some more fibre to
