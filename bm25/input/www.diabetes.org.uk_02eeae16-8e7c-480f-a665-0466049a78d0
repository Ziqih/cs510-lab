>>>>>>>> The highs and lows still happen, whether that's with blood sugar
readings or emotionally, but having the condition keeps me focussed on making
sure I'm making the most out of anything that I do.

his diabetes get in the way of his passions. He also shares how the
coronavirus outbreak has impacted his ability and outlook on travel.
>>>>>>> Ted Lamb shares experiences aboutDiagnosisLife with diabetes
>>>>>>> I was diagnosed with type 1 in July 2005, right at the end of school
when I was 16. I think I went through a fairly standard set of problems before
diagnosis, a few days of severe lethargy and thirst (with the constating
peeing associated with that!) and I lost a lot of weight very quickly, which
for several months afterwards was a big problem for me with the consistent
high blood sugar. I didn't notice it so much at the time but looking at old
pictures you can see how sick I was! I was definitely confused when I first
found out I had diabetes. I didn't understand how or why I'd been stuck with
what I thought was such a raw deal considering none of my family have it. I
felt fairly isolated from my friends as they weren't going through the same
>>>>>>> The initial treatment was from the team at the Bournemouth Hospital
Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, and still is 15 years later! I was given the
Novorapid and Lantus pens, as well as my first BG meter and a whole host of
info leaflets and a couple of books to help me out. The team in Bournemouth
>>>>>>> To be honest, I feel the treatment I receive now is fairly similar to
when I was first diagnosed. However, the fact that I can email my healthcare
team if I have any problems and get a really quick response is a really big
difference compared to when I was first diagnosed. I feel there is a lot of
information online that you can take advantage of if you feel like you need
>>>>>>> I think as tough as type 1 can be, it's also made me far more
resilient than I would be without it. The highs and lows still happen, whether
that's with blood sugar readings or emotionally, but having the condition
keeps me focussed on making sure I'm making the most out of anything that I
do, because you never know when your health can change for the worse. I take
the condition day by day and I don't worry if I have a bad day, because you
can always make the next day better, be realistic about what you can do
because of the condition but also stay positive because it could always be

definitely understand the dangers of the condition but they have always been
>>>>>>> They understand the physical effects and know what I need to do in
most situations, or even if not exactly why, they know to take it seriously
when I tell them something is wrong or if I'm not acting myself because of a
hypo. I think my girlfriend is the only one who really knows how much of a

>>>>>>> I didn't understand how or why I'd been stuck with what I thought was
such a raw deal considering none of my family have it.
>>>>>>> Life changed fairly drastically for me at the beginning of lockdown,
as I was living and working in the mountains of Whistler, British Columbia for
several months. But with the health risks of the coronavirus pandemic I had to
come back to the UK to be closer to my family in case anything went wrong.
It’s been a challenging change of pace, but to be honest I've really enjoyed
having the time to work on projects and ideas that I haven't had the chance to
previously. My blood glucose numbers have been about the same, just maybe
>>>>>>> I’m excited about the prospect of travelling again and I'm hoping to
be able to start taking some smaller trips around Europe in the new year.
>>>>>>> I think travel is one of the best things people can do to build
confidence in themselves. I think everyone should travel as much as possible.
I’m not nervous as I think as long as you take the correct precautions and
keep yourself up to date with any new travel safety advice, then it shouldn't
cause any extra worry. I have a rule in that if I don't feel entirely sure, or
confident, in going somewhere then I ask myself why and try to either educate
myself further, or choose somewhere else to travel to, and I think this is
>>>>>>> Being someone with type 1 means there are a host of precautions I
usually take with travelling. First and foremost, I'll usually try to discuss
the trip with my doctor or nurses if I'm going somewhere for an extended
amount of time, making sure that I have all the supplies I'll need. Research
is definitely key, so I spend as much time as I can looking at things such as
local healthcare, common foods, travel times, and of course any required
paperwork. Things such as the cost of and availability of insulin in the
>>>>>>> I think while some countries are still heavily affected by the virus,
my precautions will mean doing far more research with regards to my potential
destinations. I'll be avoiding places too far from home for a while, and
ensuring that I check all of the relevant government websites and local
healthcare options before booking a ticket anywhere. I would also definitely
take extra face masks and hand sanitizer for traveling in airports and keeping
my social distancing up in foreign destinations. Some people may see this as
over the top, but I feel like it's better to be safe than sorry.
>>>>>>>> Preparation is key. The less you have to worry about your diabetes
when you travel, the easier it becomes, and likewise, the less you have to
stress about the travel the easier the diabetes management becomes.
>>>>>>> I always do my best to mentally prepare myself for a trip, and I
usually pack and repack my bag with my medical supplies several times before
I'm confident that I have everything that I need! It's also really important
that you know your own limits, and know when to take time to rest, or when to
say “Thanks but no thanks” to an experience that can put you at risk. Travel
is fantastic for building your confidence and helping you get out of your
comfort zone, but it's very important to know when something might be too
>>>>>>> The best advice I can give to others with type 1 would be to make sure
you are prepared and have confidence in your own abilities. Also, if it is
your first time travelling with the condition, consider keeping the trip
simple. At the beginning of the year, I started offering a consultation
service Type One Travel, for anyone who wishes to travel with type 1 and feels
