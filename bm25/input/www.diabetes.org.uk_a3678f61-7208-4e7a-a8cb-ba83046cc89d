# Planning for a pregnancy when you have diabetes
### Most women with diabetes have a healthy baby. But planning for pregnancy
Having diabetes means that you and your baby are more at risk of serious
health complications during pregnancy and childbirth. The good news is that by
planning ahead and getting support from your GP and diabetes team, you can
really reduce the risks involved. So you’re more likely to enjoy a healthy
pregnancy and give birth to a healthy baby.
Everyone's experience of pregnancy is different, and planning for it is
important whether you have type 2, type 1, or another type of diabetes. And
we've got lots of information for you if you have gestational diabetes. Here's
Lucy talking about her experiences of pregnancy and type 1.
## **How to prepare for pregnancy when you have diabetes**
Start taking the following steps to help you prepare for a healthy pregnancy:
* Keep using effective contraception (birth control) until you want to try for a baby
* Get to know the risks involved and how to reduce them
* Keep your blood sugar to your target levels
* Check what medication you’re taking, as some can harm the baby
* Make healthy lifestyle choices – like eating well, cutting down on drinking alcohol, quitting smoking and getting active.
You’re not on your own, there’s lots of support to help you. You’ll get this
from your healthcare team, but talk to your family and friends too.
We’re here to help support you. We have lots of useful information to help you
plan a healthy pregnancy, and if you still have more questions, give our
helpline a call. Our helpline has highly trained advisors with counselling
skills, and an extensive knowledge of diabetes to talk things through with

There are risks involved, but knowing what they are means you can take steps
to reduce them. Let’s talk about the risks:
* You may have problems with your eyes and kidneys
* It’s more likely you’ll have a larger baby – this can make the birth more painful and possible stress for the baby. So you may need a caesarian (C-section).
* Your baby may be born with serious health problems, such as spina bifida. This is where the baby’s spine doesn’t develop properly.
There is also a risk of stillbirth, or your baby dying at around the time of
birth. This is rare, but there’s more risk for women with diabetes.
But remember, you can greatly reduce these risks by planning ahead and getting
support. Giving yourself enough time to prepare and look after yourself can
help you on your way to having a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby.
The first step in planning ahead is to make an appointment with your GP or
Diabetes Specialist Nurse. You should do this before stopping any

Knowing what to expect when you're pregnant, and after the birth will help you
plan a healthy pregnancy. It’s not just about understanding how diabetes
affects pregnancy, but also how pregnancy affects diabetes.
You’re more likely to have a healthy baby if you manage your blood sugar
levels before you get pregnant, as well as during pregnancy.
You’ll need to get your HbA1c checked before you stop using contraception.
This is because a high HbA1c level can affect how a baby develops. This is
really important in the first trimester (first 8 weeks of pregnancy), because
It’s safest to keep your HbA1c level below 48mmol/mol.
If yours higher than 48mmol/mol, taking steps to safely bring it down will
help reduce your risks. But if your HbA1c is over 86mmol/mol, it’s not safe to
get pregnant and you should talk to your healthcare team for advice.
You’ll also need to check your blood sugar levels more regularly at home. This
is so you can try to keep them in a safe range during the day.
If you have Type 1 diabetes, you’ll already have a blood sugar testing kit,
but make sure it checks for ketones too.
If you have Type 2 diabetes and don’t have a blood sugar testing kit, ask your
Here’s an example of some targets to aim for:
* when you wake up and haven’t eaten yet – 5 to 7mmol/l
* before meals at other times of the day – 4 to 7mmol/l
* 90 minutes after meals – 5 to 9mmol/l.
Your diabetes team can help you set these targets – they may be different
depending on your situation. They can also help you reach these targets, so
you can reduce the risks for you and your baby.
Some diabetes medications aren’t safe to take when you’re planning a
pregnancy. You’ll need to get advice from your GP or nurse about which ones to
stop. Metformin and insulin are safe to take.
If you’re taking certain medications to treat other health conditions, you
might need to stop these too. These include:
Tell your doctor if you take any of these. They will be able to give you
After your baby is born, you can usually go back to the medication you were
taking before. But if you’re breastfeeding, stick to your doctor’s advice and
keep avoiding all the medication you stopped taking before you were pregnant.
If you were taking glibenclamide, it’s safe to start taking that again.
We have more information for you if you’re breastfeeding.
Your doctor or nurse will prescribe you a high-dose folic acid (5mg) to take
as soon as you decide you want to get pregnant _._ You should be taking folic
acid 5mgs each day at least 12 weeks before you conceive as this also reduces
the risks to your baby. You’ll then need to keep taking this until you’re 12
This higher dose of folic acid is only available on prescription. You can’t
Pregnancy can make some diabetes complications worse, such as eye and kidney
problems. So it’s really important to have eye screening and tests for your
kidneys before you stop using contraception. Eye problems because of diabetes
(diabetic retinopathy) can be treated if caught early, so screening is really
Your diabetes team can arrange this and they’ll talk to you about the results.
In some cases, you may be referred to a specialist team for extra support.
Deciding to try for a baby is just as exciting for you as it is for everyone
else. And there’s every reason to look forward to a successful pregnancy and a
But having diabetes means there are more risks involved. It’s harder work as a
result – with more checks, appointments and scans. And keeping very tight
control of your blood sugar levels can be tiring and stressful at times.
If you have a partner, it’s a good idea to explain all this so they can
support you from the beginning. Or ask your friends or family to give you that
