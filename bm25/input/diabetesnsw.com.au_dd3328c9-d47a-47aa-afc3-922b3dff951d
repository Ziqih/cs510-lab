Researchers in South Korea, have developed smart technology that allows for
the diagnosis of diabetes and treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
Professor Sei Kwang Hahn and his team from POSTECH have invented a smart
photonic contact lens and a wearable medical device which can diagnose
The team successfully developed a smart contact lens with an integrated micro
LED and photodetector which can measure glucose concentration in the
conjunctival blood vessels by analysing the NIR light. With this development,
When they then tested their new smart LED contact as a treatment for diabetic
retinopathy in rabbits they found a significant reduction in the production of
new blood vessels in the retina, verifying the clinical feasibility of the
contact lens as a therapy for diabetic retinopathy.
Professor Hahn said, “This newly developed device will not only let people
living with diabetes monitor their blood glucose levels in real-time, it will
also enable medical treatment for retinopathy – a common complication from
On the basis of the current results, Professor Hahn and his team also
developed a smart wearable medical device that can analyse the glucose
concentration in sweat. This is something they are working to verify could
In relation to the results of the research Professor Hahn said, “The
development of the smart LED contact lens that can diagnose diabetes and treat
diabetic retinopathy with light is a world first. We now have to work to make
this technology commercially viable and affordable for people living with
