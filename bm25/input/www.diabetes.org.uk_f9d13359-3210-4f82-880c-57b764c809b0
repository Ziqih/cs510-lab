still be active when you have type 1 diabetes.

>>>>>>> I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was five, so I’m well
versed in managing my condition. I use the FreeStyle Libre, which is handy as
my job as a PE teacher means my activity levels vary a lot, so my diabetes
>>>>>>> My levels are pretty spot on at the moment but that’s not to say they
will be in a few days’ time. Since the lockdown I’ve been nowhere near as
active. I would usually cycle to school each day, but I’m working from home at
the moment and my usual 10-15k steps a day is closer to 3-4k around the house
or in the garden. My wife is a nurse so is still going out to work. When she’s
at home at the weekends and can watch the children, I’ll try and get out for a
run or a cycle. I’m trying to get my little boy to ride without stabilisers so
we can go out a bit further together. We’ve also been doing the Joe Wicks
workouts, which are great. In fact, I’ve been telling my students to try them,
as it’s important they keep fit and active during this time.
>>>>>>> * Find out more about type 1 diabetes
>>>>>>> I always wanted to do a job that involved sport, whether that was
coaching or teaching. I would’ve been so bored in an office. I did a sports
degree at university and teacher training after that.
>>>>>>> For quite a while, I didn’t want to tell anyone I had diabetes. I was
worried they’d treat me differently. But wearing a sensor on my arm means that
my students often ask what it is. These days I’m much more open about my
diabetes, so I’m always happy to have a conversation with them about my
condition and what it means. What’s nice about my job is that students can see
I still lead a normal life and you can still be active if you have type 1.
>>>>>>> My students are great. I’m on an insulin pump and one day when I was
teaching a Year 11 girls’ rugby team, I got knocked over whilst holding a
tackle shield. They were really concerned about me. One girl even checked if
my pump was OK. I’ve once had trouble in a lesson because I’ve gone hypo and a
student needed to get me something from the vending machine. I’ve had times
when I’ve gone low and my blood sugar hasn’t come back up as quickly as I
would have hoped. When that happens I’ll sit on a bench on the side and say to
the children, “Right, could you do this for the next five minutes,” while I
recover or just ensure they are in a game situation where I can oversee while
>>>>>>> ### Keeping on top of blood sugar levels
>>>>>>> Managing diabetes when you have an active job isn’t easy, but it’s a
case of thinking about everything you might need to help you get through the
day and having back up plans. These days, I make sure I’ve got plenty of hypo
treatments on me and I try to do lots of testing and scanning, so I’m on top
of my blood sugars. It’s also helpful for recognising that there are times
when I need to change my basal rate, or put a temporary one in place.
>>>>>>> The hardest thing is the surprise of your blood sugars not doing what
you expect, I’m always looking for a reason. That can be helpful, but it can
also be frustrating. That must be the teacher in me, trying to evaluate where
it’s gone wrong, so I can work out how to avoid it next time. That’s part of
the problems that come with diabetes, and it’s important not to let it hold
you back. I try to remind myself that even people with the best control will
have rubbish days. Just because something has worked one day, doesn’t mean it

>>>>>>> Daily life is quite different at the moment. Alongside my wife, we’re
currently home schooling our little boy. He’s only five so a lot of it is
learning through play. We had tears and tantrums the other day because he lost
>>>>>>> I’ve been working from home since Boris Johnson’s announcement on 16th
March, where he advised people with underlying health conditions to avoid
social contact. I told my school’s headteacher that I needed to make the
decision to stay at home, which was fully supported. When everything came out
about shielding I was unsure as to what I was supposed to be doing, but the
school said they don’t expect to see me for the foreseeable future. It was
really nice to get that reassurance. I have friends with diabetes who I know
are having problems. They’re either being messed around by their employers or
>>>>>>> I don’t think there has been clear enough guidelines from the
government as to what people with diabetes should be doing in terms of
employment. This then leaves bosses and companies open to forcing you to make
the choice as an individual, which could potentially put your health at risk.
Do you say ‘I won’t go to work because I’m worried and I know the right thing
to do is stay away from everyone, because of the impact this could have?’
>>>>>>> For me, the government should be providing guidance and saying if you
suffer with certain underlying health conditions not covered by the shielding
letters, you should not be mixing, you should work from home, and then
ensuring your employer is doing what they can to support you with this.
>>>>>>> I’m quite worried about going back to work. For me, I don’t know how I
could teach sports given the close proximity people would be in. In school
changing rooms we have between 30 and 40 students. If you had to keep two
metres apart, you would fit eight students in a changing room at once. And
what about handling equipment? I’m not sure what sport you can do with a class
full of students where it can be safe for them and the staff.
>>>>>>> As a head of year, I very much have a pastoral role and now more than
ever it’s so important for me to be supporting students and their families. I
went through a phase of teaching things like the components of fitness and
training, but now parents have said they will use that time to get their kids
to do some activity. The students are telling me what they’ve been doing,
which is great to hear. Maybe it’s a walk with their family or 20 minutes on
>>>>>>> At the moment, it’s all about adapting and the most important thing is
for families to keep each other safe, and spend time together.

supposed to be doing, but the school said they don’t expect to see me for the
