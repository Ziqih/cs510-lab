# What's new in the world of diabetes medications
Almost all medications or products for which therapeutic claims are made must
be entered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before it
can be supplied in Australia. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration
(TGA) carry out a range of assessment and monitoring activities to ensure
therapeutic goods, such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems or
insulin pumps available in Australia are of an acceptable standard. The TGA
generally has it as a pre-requisite that products are approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), or their European counterpart the European
Medicines Agency (EMA), before testing can commence in Australia.
New medications are slow to come through as it is costly to develop and market
them. According to the Tufts Centre for the Study of Drug Development, the
cost of bringing a new drug from its conception to shelves was about $320
million in the 1990s. By 2017 it had risen to around $2.7 billion. These high
costs and uncertainty regarding return on investments limits investments by
pharmaceutical companies in the development of new medications for diabetes.
Afrezza is a man-made, inhaled, rapid-acting insulin with a very fast onset
(the time it takes for insulin to start working) and fast offset (the time it
takes for insulin to finish working). Its blood-glucose-lowering action peaks
just 12 minutes after inhaling, compared to over 30 minutes for typical rapid-
acting mealtime insulins such as Novorapid, Humalog and Apidra. It is
generally used in conjunction with long-acting insulin, but it is not
recommended in people who smoke or have recently stopped smoking. Afrezza is
currently available only in the US and for adults only.
A biosimilar medicine is a highly similar version of a reference biological
medicine. The processes that produce biological and biosimilar medicines are
naturally variable as they come from living cells; this means that no two
batches are ever exactly the same. Biosimilar medicines have been tested and
proven to be as safe and effective as the reference biological medicine.
Lantus is a biological medication that has been used successfully for many
years. However, Lantus Solostar and Lantus insulin glargine 100 IU/mL products
were removed from the Australian market from 1 July 2020. If you are using
either of these products you will need to change to another insulin glargine
Optisulin is the same formulation as Lantus and is available in two delivery
methods: a prefilled disposable injector pen (Optisulin Solostar) and
cartridges for use in reusable injector pens (AllStar, AllStar Pro, JuniorStar
Semglee is a biosimilar insulin Glargine U-100 which is only available in pre-
filled disposable pens. It has been listed and marked as “equivalent for the
purposes of substitution for Lantus” on the PBS since 1 October 2019. Talk to
your doctor before changing from Lantus to Semglee as these two insulins are
Fiasp is a variation of insulin aspart, better known as Novorapid, but is
absorbed faster as it has niacinamide (vitamin B3) and arginine (an amino
acid) added. Fiasp has a faster onset and faster, higher peak than Novorapid
and thereby provides quicker insulin cover at meals, while the duration of
action is similar to Novorapid. This means that Fiasp allows you to delay
injectioning until the first bite of your meal or within 20 minutes of
starting a meal, allowing you to decide how much you are going to eat and dose
accordingly. Fiasp has been on the PBS for about one year, it is available at
the same cost as other rapid acting insulins.
Ryzodeg® 70/30 has been available on the PBS since August 2018, but we thought
it is worth a mention here anyway. Ryzodeg 70/30 contains two types of
insulin: a basal (or background) insulin called insulin degludec and rapid
acting insulin called insulin aspart (more commonly known as Novorapid).
Compared to other basal insulins (such as insulin detemir (Levemir) which
lasts around 20 hours or insulin glargine (see above) which works for up to 24
hours), Degludec has a duration of action beyond 42 hours and this means that
there is less variation in your blood glucose levels from one day to the next,
even if you vary the timing of your injections.
Tresiba is a single ingredient insulin degludec and has been available in the
UK and US since 2015. The Australian TGA approved it for use by adults at the
same time as Ryzodeg in November 2017; however, Tresiba is not yet subsidised
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists work by stimulating the
release of insulin by the pancreas after eating, even before the blood glucose
levels start to rise. At the same time GLP-1 inhibits the release of glucagon
by the pancreas, which slows down the release of stored glucose from the
liver. Thirdly, GLP-1 slows the absorption of glucose into the blood stream,
by slowing stomach emptying; this makes you feel fuller for longer.
The chemical structure of GLP-1 and duration of action is different for
different brands. There are several GLP-1 receptor agonists available to
people with type 2 diabetes, though only four of them are currently available
in Australia, three of which are on the PBS. GLP-1 is mostly an injectable
medication (but it is not insulin) that generally comes in a pre-filled,
***Dulaglutide,** known in Australia as Trulicity, is a once weekly GLP-1 available on the PBS with an authority prescription.
***Exenatide** comes in two formulations. Byetta, a twice daily injection and Bydureon, a once weekly injection. Both are available on the PBS.
***Liraglutide** is known as either Vyctoza or Saxenda; both are available in Australia, but on a private script only. Vyctoza is used to treat type 2 diabetes, whereas Saxenda is marketed for people who do not have diabetes but who are overweight or obese.
***Lixisenatide** or Lyxumia was registered with the TGA in 2013 but is not yet available on the PBS.
***Semaglutide** is marketed as Ozempic and is another once weekly GLP-1. It was approved for listing on the PBS in November 2019.
There are two honourable mentions for other GLP-1 preparations:
Rybelsus is the first pill in the class of drugs called ‘glucagon-like
peptide’ approved for use in the US. The generic name is semaglutide. However,
it appears that this medication has some significant risks as recent studies
have shown that it may cause certain thyroid tumours and can cause
inflammation of the pancreas, kidney injury, vision loss and hypoglycaemia
(low blood glucose levels) and so it remains to be seen if it ever makes it
The makers of Optisulin (formerly known as Lantus, insulin Glargine U-100)
have created a two-in-one medication which includes both insulin Glargine and
Lixisenatide. Sanofi has submitted an application with the PBS for this
medication to be available on the Australian market.
In the last 12 months we have seen the addition of a new sodium-glucose co-
transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor called Steglatro (Ertugliflozin) added to the
list of PBS medications. SGLT-2 inhibitors help lower blood glucose levels in
people with type 2 diabetes by removing glucose from the body through the
urine. Other SGLT-2 medications available in Australia include dapagliflozin
Steglujan is a combination medication of the aforementioned SGLT-2 inhibitor
Segluromet also has two active drugs, they are the SGLT-2 inhibitor
ertugliflozin and metformin (also known as Diabex or Diaformin), which is a
common medication and belongs to a group of medications called biguanides.
Trijardy XR is the first triple-combination medication that has been approved
by the FDA; it contains empagliflozin (Jardiance), linagliptin (Trajenta), and
extended-release metformin hydrochloride (Diabex XR or Diaformin XR). Although
it has FDA approval, it is yet to make its way across to Australia.
