>>>>>>> In 2017, we set up our Diabetes Research Steering Groups (formerly the
Clinical Studies Groups) help improve the lives of people with or at risk of
diabetes through research. The groups bring together researchers, healthcare
professionals and people living with or at risk of diabetes, pinpoint
precisely where more research needs to happen so we can make the greatest
possible difference to the lives of people with diabetes.
>>>>>>> We know that everyone with diabetes is different. And the Diabetes
Research Steering Groups (DRSGs) understand the importance of listening to as
many voices as possible and bringing unheard voices into diabetes research.
>>>>>>> Want to learn more about the DRSGs? Want to get involved with the
initiative? We are always on the lookout for new ideas and insight from with
people with or at risk of diabetes, researchers, funders and healthcare
>>>>>>> We are currently seeking a Chair for the Leadership Panel, who oversee
the DRSG Initiative. Comprised of individual group Chairs and independent
experts, this group provides oversight and brings in external insight to
ensure the groups are function effectively. For more information, please see

ways to address them, so future research will:

impact on people’s lives to scientists and other research funders, the DRSGs
direct and increase the amount of diabetes research being done across the UK.
>>>>>>> Though groups often work together, each group focuses on a different
>>>>>>> We put the insights of the DRSGs at the heart of our new research
strategy. It lays out key research priorities the groups have identified,
along with our plans to work with the DRSGs and the wider research community
to get research in these urgent areas off the ground. By using the work of the
DRSGs as a foundation we can be sure we’re driving forward research that
>>>>>>> The DRSGs have told us there’s an urgent research gap around
preventing or slowing the complications of diabetes in people at very high
risk. We teamed up with the National Institute for Health Research – the
nation’s largest health research funder – to invest in research to find
answers. We’re asking scientists to apply for this funding to help us delve
deeper into why some people are at very high risk and develop better ways to
prevent or slow complications. We want to make sure no one falls between the
>>>>>>> * ### Mental Wellbeing Workshop and Strategic Call
>>>>>>> We held a workshop with world renowned researchers, from across our
DRSGs and beyond, and people living with diabetes to agree the priority
research areas in mental wellbeing and diabetes. They agreed 11 priority areas
and agreed on recommendations for the research community. You can read a
detailed report of the priorities and research recommendations published in
our journal, Diabetic Medicine. And we’re already taking steps to get this
research off the ground. In June 2019, we invited scientists to apply for
funding on eating disorders research, one of the priority areas.
>>>>>>> Discussions at DRSG meetings highlighted that managing diabetes in
times of hormonal change can be tough, and that advice and support just wasn’t
there. It became clear that the impact of changing hormones on diabetes
management isn’t well understood, with the effects of the menopause on
diabetes emerged as an area in particular need of more research. To start
getting the answers we need, we launched a highlight notice, encouraging
researchers to submit proposals investigating menopause and diabetes in our
>>>>>>> * ### Remote glucose monitoring highlight notice
>>>>>>> The DRSGs told us that the use of remote glucose monitoring
technologies, which can be used to check blood sugar levels from a central
dashboard, in hospitals and other inpatient settings is currently limited. To
encourage more exploration of this promising area, we launched a highlight
notice for research into new glucose monitoring technologies in our funding
