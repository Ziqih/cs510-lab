Fibre is a silent assistant when it comes to keeping our bodies healthy, free
of disease. Whilst it is a carbohydrate, fibre is unavailable and therefore
doesn't breakdown into glucose. Soluble fibre (dissolves in water eg. oats,
legumes, apples, psyllium) helps to lower cholesterol and manage blood glucose
levels. Whereas insoluble fibre (does not dissolve in water eg. wheat bran,
nuts, vegetable and fruit skins) is excellent for healthy bowel function.
Women living with diabetes need to try and achieve 28g of fibre a day(d)
whilst men require 38g/d. Eating plenty of vegetables including legumes,
fruits and wholegrains will help you achieve these targets.
