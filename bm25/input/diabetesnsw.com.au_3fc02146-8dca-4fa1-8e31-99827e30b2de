risk of a number of chronic diseases, including cancer, but also experience
positive short-term impacts such as feeling great mentally, and having more
energy during the day. Need further convincing? Read on for more reasons to
1. According to the Cancer Council of Australia, physical inactivity is responsible for 14% of colon cancers and 11% of post-menopausal breast cancers. Experts believe that it may also contribute to many other cancers. So do yourself a favour and join in the fight against developing cancer by being physically active every day.
2. Exercise can help to normalise blood glucose levels and help you avoid age-related decline in muscle mass or muscle wastage. Add in a healthy eating plan, and you could be losing weight too.
3. Regular physical activity can reduce dependence on medications by helping improve heart health, insulin sensitivity and blood glucose control.
4. Your brain loves exercise! Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, which helps to boost mental focus, concentration and alertness.
5. Regular exercise can release feel-good brain chemicals (endorphins) that improve mood and can also reduce immune system chemicals that increase depression.
At least 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise a day (3-4 rating
out of 10) is recommended to promote good health.
Evidence suggests that exercise works on a dose-relationship response, meaning
the more you do, the more positive health benefits occur. Aerobic exercise can
include activities such as brisk walking, swimming, dancing or aerobics
classes. It's also recommended that you include resistance training at least
twice a week. This can include lifting light weights or performing body weight
