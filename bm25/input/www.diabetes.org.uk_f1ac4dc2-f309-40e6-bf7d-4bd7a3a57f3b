A diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes can affect the whole family. It’s important to
listen to, and communicate with, all members of your family – especially any
other children – and get help and support if you or anyone else needs it.
While you’re getting to grips with your child’s diabetes, it’s easy to forget
about the needs of your other children. But, they, too, will be affected by
their sibling’s diagnosis. They may feel that their brother or sister is
getting special treatment, worry that their sibling will get really sick or be
Rivalry and jealousy are common in most families, and a child with diabetes
can cause upset between siblings. In the early days, after diagnosis, it’s
only natural for you to be anxious and focus your attention and care on your
child with diabetes. But, regular hospital visits, attention to diet and
everything else that goes with diabetes has a longer-term impact on all the

* Try not to put family life on hold.
It can be a challenge to manage a child’s diabetes when they go from one home
to another. Whatever your feelings about your ex, the two of you need to work

When your child is diagnosed with diabetes, it’s natural for grandparents,
aunts and uncles, etc to be as upset and worried as you are. They may be in
constant contact, asking for updates or how they can help – or they may leave
* Keep one person up to date. This person can then update everyone else: group texts and emails work well for this.
* Ask for the help you need. Perhaps you’d like someone to look after your other children, do a bit of shopping for you or walk the dog? People often want to help, but don’t know what to do.
* Think about the future. Your family will be living with Type 1 diabetes from now on, so how can your extended family best support you? If your child is used to staying over with relatives, it’s important that they still do so. If grandparents and other family members are worried about looking after them, try involving them in your child’s diabetes care. You could also bring them to clinic appointments to help them learn more about diabetes and ask questions for themselves.
