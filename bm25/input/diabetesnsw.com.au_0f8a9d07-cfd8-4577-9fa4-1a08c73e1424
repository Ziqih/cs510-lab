DiaBuddies Days is one of our most loved programs and we’re excited to

Sessions for parents and carers are an opportunity to connect with others

pandemic as people with type 2 diabetes find new ways to stay connected.
Dozens of medical case reports indicate that COVID-19 might trigger diabetes
in people with no history of the condition.
