* Choose wholegrain varieties of starchy carbs such as wholemeal rice or pasta in salads, potato salads with the skins left on, and wholegrain bread for sandwiches.
* For cold meats, try leaner options such as chicken or turkey breast rather than salami or ham.
* Add crunch to sandwiches with extra veggies such as pepper, carrot, cucumber and lettuce.
* Use beans and pulses in a salad to up the protein content and to make it more filling.
* Swap sugary and fatty treats such as cake and crisps for healthier alternatives – mixed nuts, fruit, unsalted rice cakes and low-fat fruit yoghurts make great replacements.
* Sip on water, no-added sugar squash or diet drinks to stay hydrated.
* Make your own dips, dressings and marinades from scratch at home to avoid the high fat, sugar and salt content from shop-bought varieties.
* From playing games to going for a walk, combine your picnic with some physical activity to maximise the health benefits.

* Reduce the opportunity for bacteria to multiply by keeping cold foods cold and hot foods hot. Salads, dairy foods, cooked meats and rice-based salads, in particular, should be kept cool until needed. Be careful they aren’t left in direct sunlight. If you haven’t yet got one, invest in a cool bag - they can be bought from most supermarkets.
* Keep the number of times a food bag or container is opened to a minimum to reduce contamination.
* Rinse fresh fruit and veg under running tap water at home before packing them.
* Hot weather brings with it the risk of dehydration – drink plenty of water, no-added sugar squashes or diet drinks. If you’re drinking alcohol, stick to safe drinking guidelines and alternate with non-alcoholic drinks.
