### Often hailed as the 'most important meal of the day', a decent breakfast
for diabetes certainly has a range of health benefits.
As well as providing nutrients, if you have diabetes, a regular healthy
breakfast can help to maintain control of blood sugar, can minimise unhealthy
snacking later on, and fuels your body to help you function ahead of a busy
When it comes to breakfast time, cereal remains a popular, convenient, and
speedy choice. With the choice on supermarket shelves growing over the years,
it can be tricky to choose the healthiest option.
To make things easier, we have chosen 10 well-known cereals and looked closely
at the nutritional value to see how they perform in terms of sugar, fat, and
But first, let's find out a little more about what breakfast for diabetes we
Breakfast cereals tend to be based on grains - some are wholegrains (such as
wheat, bran, oats), and others are refined grains (such as maize and rice).
Many also have nuts, seeds and dried fruit added to them.
Wholegrain cereals can help to manage blood glucose levels, particularly if
you have type 2 diabetes, as they release glucose more slowly as they are low
Recent guidelines highlighted that, as a UK population, we are having too much
sugar and not enough fibre. Fibre is important for gut health and some can
help towards lowering cholesterol. Some cereals also contain vitamins and
minerals such as iron, vitamin D, and B vitamins such as folic acid.
Folic acid is important for healthy red blood cells and also needs to be taken
as a supplement both before, and during, pregnancy to reduce the risk of
neural tube defects in unborn babies. Folic acid is especially important in
pregnant women with diabetes as they need a higher than normal dose in order
However, beware - some cereals that may appear healthy are not always as good
for you as they seem... they can contain high amounts of free sugars and are

Two of the breakfast cereals - Nestle Shredded Wheat and Weetabix - were all
green, meaning they're low in sugar, fat, saturated fat and salt.

* ![Diabetic breakfast](https://diabetes-resources-production.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/resources-s3/migration/apporridge280x186.jpg)Be aware of portion sizes - consider whether the portion size suggested on the box is the same as the portion size you're consuming. Many people pour a larger bowl and therefore consume more calories and more carbohydrate. This is important if you're counting calories to control weight, or if you carb count to adjust the correct dose of insulin.
* Weigh your cereal a couple of times to get an idea of the amount you usually consume and then keep a note of this along with other foods you consume on a regular basis. Use this weight against the per 100g values to calculate your intake.
* Another tip when carb counting - remember to allow for the extras you have added to your cereal such as milk, fruit or yogurt.
* Check the label for fibre and try to choose a cereal with a higher fibre content.
* The type of milk you choose to put on your cereal can also contribute to overall health - choosing semi-skimmed or skimmed instead of whole milk can reduce your overall fat intake for the day.
* Try to choose cereals that are graded green for sugar, where possible.
Whatever your choice for breakfast for your diabetes, it's important to
maintain a regular meal pattern and try to make time to eat breakfast each

If you don't feel hungry first thing, try keeping a box of healthy cereal or
