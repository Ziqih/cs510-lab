# Increasing our fibre intake could save the economy $3.3 billion a year
New research, conducted by Deloitte Access Economics and Nutrition Research
Australia, shows that if every Australian adult adds two to three serves of
high fibre grain food to their daily diet it could save the economy an
estimated $3.3 billion a year from reduced healthcare costs and lost
Almost half of Australian adults are deliberately limiting their intake of
grain foods and four out of five **** are not getting enough fibre to help
reduce the risk of chronic disease, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2
The research, commissioned by Kellogg Australia, shows that cardiovascular
disease and type 2 diabetes currently cost the economy almost $22 billion a
year in healthcare costs and lost productivity. Given the effectiveness of
grain fibre in reducing the risk of these chronic diseases, the research
looked into how increasing our grain fibre intake may help to reduce the
Modelling by Deloitte Access Economics show that if every Australian adult
adds just one serve of high fibre grain food each day, which contains four to
five grams of grain fibre, it could save the economy $1.5 billion and help
prevent 64,000 cases **** of cardiovascular disease and 126,000 cases of type
The Assistant Minister for Health, Dr David Gillespie, welcomed these latest
“These are Australia’s two most prevalent chronic diseases, and have a
significant impact on Australia’s economy in direct healthcare expenditure and
lost productivity. The research indicates that fibre from grains has the
greatest potential to reduce the combined risk of developing these two
“If all Australians added a small amount of extra grain fibre each day to
their diet, we could significantly improve the health of hundreds of thousands
of Australians, as well as the health of the economy.
“Adding more fibre to your diet is as simple as eating fruit, vegetables,
cereals and wholegrains each day, as recommended by the Australian Dietary
“The health and wellbeing of our nation is our top priority and we are
determined to ensure that the importance of fibre is not overlooked.”
Kellogg Australia and New Zealand Managing Director, Belinda Tumbers, said the
research may indicate that Australians don't realise the importance of fibre
“This research demonstrates the importance of fibre, especially grain fibre,
and the big impact it can have on both our health and the economy. Hopefully
it will act as a reminder for people to eat more high fibre grain foods to
The research examined data from the Australian Health Survey to determine the
current fibre intakes of Australians. Grain fibre, because of its already
proven potential to reduce risk, was then used to model increases in intakes
 **Foods containing four to five grams of grain fibre include:**
* A bowl of high fibre cereal or porridge
* ¼ cup of whole grains such as barley or corn
