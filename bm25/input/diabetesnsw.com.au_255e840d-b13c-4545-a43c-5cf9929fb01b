# Statins linked to increased risk of skin infections and diabetes
New Australian research led by Curtin University has found that people who
have used statins for as little as three months have an increased risk of skin
The research, published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology,
examined prescription claims from 2001 to 2011 from the Australian Department
of Veterans’ Affairs to determine whether there was a link between statins,
Lead author Humphrey Ko, from Curtin’s School of Pharmacy and Biomedical
Sciences and the Curtin Health Innovation Research Institute (CHIRI), said
although statins are commonly prescribed by health professionals around the
world to treat cardiovascular diseases, there is increasing interest that
these medications may also benefit other medical conditions.
“Staphylococcus aureus, also known as S. aureus, is a major cause of bacterial
skin infections and statins have been reported to exert antibacterial effects
against S. aureus, as well as reduce the risk of S. aureus-related blood
infections. As such, it seemed plausible that statins may prove beneficial in
S. aureus-related skin infections. However, statins may also induce new-onset
diabetes, a condition which in turn is a risk factor for skin infections,” Mr
“In light of the conflicting research on this topic, our study evaluated
antibiotics, investigating their interrelationships at three, six, and 12
“We discovered that the use of statins for as little as three months was
associated with an increased risk of diabetes and skin and soft tissue
infections. We also found that the increased risk of skin infections appeared
Mr Ko explained that the findings have important implications for health care
professionals around the world who regularly prescribe statin medication for
“The widespread use of statins will likely continue with guidelines across the
world recommending statin use for prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
Hence, there is a need for clinicians to be mindful that statin use may also
be associated with diabetes, as well as a possible increased risk of skin
infections. Statin users who are predisposed to diabetes would likely benefit
“Further research is needed to verify the link between statins and diabetes,
statins and skin infections, as well as the influence of statins’ effect on
human gut bacteria, vitamin D levels, and cholesterol inhibition on skin
