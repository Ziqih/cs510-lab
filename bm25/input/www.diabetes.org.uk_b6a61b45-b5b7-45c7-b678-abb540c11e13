>>>>>>> Reena didn’t have any noticeable signs or symptoms of gestational
diabetes when she was diagnosed at 28 weeks pregnant. Not long after
diagnosis, she started to experience some of the signs of diabetes, including
extreme thirst and tiredness. At the start, she was able to manage her blood
sugar levels with changes to her diet and physical activity. But after a
while, she found that she couldn’t manage her blood sugar levels by this

>>>>>>> I was around 22 weeks pregnant with my daughter when the midwife
picked up that I had sugar in my urine at a routine check-up. She asked me
what I’d had for breakfast that day and I immediately felt bad. I’d had a
raisin bagel and a smoothie that morning and thought that whatever she’d
>>>>>>> My midwife referred me to the hospital to do an Oral Glucose Tolerance
Test (OGTT). I didn’t think I needed to worry about diabetes as I wasn’t
overweight, but my South Asian background was a risk factor for gestational
diabetes, which I hadn’t realised up to this point.
>>>>>>> The day after I took the test I got the call from the hospital to say
my result wasn’t normal and I needed to attend the diabetes clinic and see a
dietitian. My appointments weren’t for a couple of weeks. So, I was told that
if I started to feel unwell I needed to get in touch with the diabetes midwife
straightaway. I was absolutely gutted, scared and really confused by the whole
thing. At the time I was also having a very stressful time at work. It was all
>>>>>>> Not long after the call from the hospital, I started to experience
extreme thirst and tiredness, so I called my diabetes midwife and she brought
my appointments forward. My symptoms of gestational diabetes came on so
suddenly. It was a real shock to go from feeling well to sick in such a short

>>>>>>> Looking back at my pregnancy, I feel more informed about diabetes now.
If I were to have a second child, I’d go into the experience much more
>>>>>>> At the start, I managed my gestational diabetes by making changes to
my diet and checking my blood sugars after every meal.
>>>>>>> The blood sugar checking was a little strange at first, but you get
used to it. Sometimes I’d get upset when I got a high reading as I was worried
I’d have to go onto medication and take insulin. In my head, the more
medications I took during pregnancy, the more medicalised the birth would need
to be and this was something I didn’t want.
>>>>>>> As my pregnancy progressed, no matter what I ate, I couldn’t manage my
gestational diabetes. My blood sugars became very unstable – I found that
foods which were OK one day would make my blood sugar level soar the next. I
was only really eating fish, eggs and vegetables and I lost 3kg. I was down
>>>>>>> My diabetes healthcare team then put me on a tablet called metformin
which helped a lot and really took the pressure off. It meant that I had far
more choice when it came to meal times and could relax more about eating.
Rather than sticking to low carb, high protein meals – which can be tricky for
someone who doesn’t eat meat – I could eat slightly more carbs which gave me
lots more energy. My mood definitely lifted too.
>>>>>>> My healthcare team also explained that metformin was a safe drug to
take in pregnancy and that it wouldn’t affect my baby, so that helped to ease
>>>>>>> Get the latest news updates about metformin from our experts.
>>>>>>> Making changes to my diet was quite tough. I tried to cut down on
sugar as much as I could, and also some sauces and juices which contained lots
of sugar. But the biggest change I made was to eat more protein and reduce my
>>>>>>> For dinner, I’d have something like fish, veg and a small portion of
potatoes, or a portion of curry and some rice. I’d then go for a walk after
>>>>>>> For a treat, I’d have berries and Greek yogurt. I was told that if I
have something sweet, I should try to eat it with protein or fat – like
cottage cheese and fruit or cheese and apple.
>>>>>>> Sometimes I felt like I was missing out, especially when I couldn’t
eat any cake at my own baby shower! I remember my friends and family kept
saying, ‘Just have a taste, a bite won’t hurt you’, but I knew a bite would
just make me realise what I was missing.
>>>>>>> As a couple, me and my husband had always loved eating out and I found
it hard not being able to choose what I wanted from the menu, especially
desserts. I remember being on holiday in Devon just before the baby was due
and not being able to eat some of my favourite foods – ice cream, cream teas
>>>>>>> My diabetes midwives and nurses at The Rosie Maternity hospital, part
of Addenbrookes hospital, were so supportive – I couldn’t have asked for
better. They offered me amazing nutritional advice and they were also very
>>>>>>> Before being diagnosed with gestational diabetes, I had taken a
hypnobirthing course and wanted to have a natural delivery in one of their
amazing birthing suites. But my midwives explained early on that this probably
wouldn’t happen as I’d have to give birth on the delivery unit and be induced
early. It was very upsetting, but, in hindsight, they really helped to manage
>>>>>>> My husband, Rog, was brilliant too. He picked up everything, bless
him. He came along to all of my appointments with me and took the time to
understand what my diagnosis meant and what changes we’d have to make. During
the birth, his support didn’t waiver for a second. We definitely navigated
gestational diabetes together, as a team, and I know that without him my
>>>>>>> Like most women with gestational diabetes, my biggest worry during my
pregnancy was whether my baby would be OK. One of the risks of gestational
diabetes is that babies can be much bigger than normal, which can cause
complications. There is also a higher risk of stillbirth, which played on my
mind. But I had lots of scans and extra checks which all turned out to be fine
>>>>>>> When Gaia was born, the midwives needed to prick her heels regularly
to check her blood sugar levels. They were very low, even when she was given
little drops of milk from a special feeding cup, so she had to be taken to the
>>>>>>> I had imagined by now I would be cuddling my baby and recovering, but
instead I found myself sitting by her incubator while she was fed by a tube.
It was upsetting, but again my midwives were amazing and reassured me she was
going to be OK. I got to spend as much time with her as I wanted – day and
night – and lots of skin to skin contact helped us bond.
>>>>>>> My little girl recovered quickly, and after a week, we were able to go
home and begin life as a family of three. Despite being a low birth weight,
she was a healthy, perfect little girl. And my gestational diabetes went
straight away after the delivery, which was a huge relief.

>>>>>>> I now try to follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly. My husband
and I have also tried to create healthy eating habits for our daughter too,
who happily eats lots of fruit and veggies.
