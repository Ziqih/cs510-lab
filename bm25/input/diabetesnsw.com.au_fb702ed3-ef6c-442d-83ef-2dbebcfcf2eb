# “Living drug factories” help treat type 1 diabetes
Researchers in the US have developed a way to protect transplanted drug-
producing cells from immune system rejection. Creating “living drug factories”
which could help treat diabetes and other conditions and diseases.
One promising way to treat diabetes is with transplanted islet cells that
produce insulin when blood sugar levels get too low. However, patients who
receive thee transplants must take drugs to prevent their immune systems from
rejecting the transplanted cells. So the treatment isn’t often used.
To help make this type of therapy more feasible, MIT researchers have now
devised a way to encapsulate therapeutic cells in a flexible protective device
that prevents immune rejection while still allowing oxygen and other critical
nutrients to reach the cells. Such cells could pump out insulin or other
“The vision is to have a “living drug factory” that you can implant in
patients, which could secrete drugs as-needed. We hope that technology like
this could be used to treat many conditions, including diabetes,” says Daniel
Anderson, Associate Professor Chemical Engineering, MIT and the senior author
In a study of mice, the researchers showed that genetically engineered human
cells remained viable for at least five months, and they believe they could
last longer to achieve long-term treatment of chronic conditions like diabetes
Patients with type 1 diabetes usually have to inject themselves with insulin
several times a day to keep their blood sugar levels within a healthy range.
Since 1999, a small number of diabetes patients have received transplanted
islet cells, which can take over for their non-functioning pancreas. While the
treatment is often effective, the immunosuppressant drugs that these patients
have to take make them vulnerable to infection and can have other serious side
For several years, Anderson’s lab has been working on ways to protect
transplanted cells from the host’s immune system, so that immunosuppressant
“We want to be able to implant cells into patients that can secrete
therapeutic factors like insulin, but prevent them from being rejected by the
body. If you build a device that can protect those cells and not require
immune suppression, you could really help a lot of people.”
To protect the transplanted cells from the immune system, the researchers
housed them inside a device built out of a silicon-based elastomer
They then coated the outer surface of the device with a small-molecule drug
called THPT. In a previous study, the researchers had discovered that this
molecule can help prevent fibrosis, a build-up of scar tissue that results
The device contains a porous membrane that allows the transplanted cells
obtain nutrients and oxygen from the bloodstream. These pores must be large
enough to allow nutrients and insulin to pass through, but small enough so
that immune cells such as T cells can’t get in and attack the transplanted
In a study of diabetic mice, the researchers showed that transplanted islets
inside microdevices maintained normal blood glucose levels in the mice for
The researchers also tested this approach with human embryonic kidney cells
that were engineered to produce erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that promotes
red blood cell production and is used to treat anemia. These therapeutic human
cells survived in mice for at least the 19-week duration of the experiment.
“The cells in the device act as a factory and continuously produce high levels
of EPO. This led to an increase in the red blood cell count in the animals for
as long as we did the experiment,” Anderson says.
The researchers also showed that they could program the transplanted cells to
produce a protein only in response to treatment with a small molecule drug.
Specifically, the transplanted engineered cells produced EPO when mice were
given the drug doxycycline. This strategy could allow for on-demand production
of a protein or hormone only when it is needed.
This type of “living drug factory” could be useful for treating any kind of
chronic illness or condition that requires frequent doses of a protein or
hormone, the researchers say. They are currently focusing on diabetes and are
working on ways to extend the lifetime of transplant.
