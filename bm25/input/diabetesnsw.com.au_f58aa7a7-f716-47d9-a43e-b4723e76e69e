Type 1 diabetes are increasing worldwide. However, scientists and researchers
Many have questioned if changes in the environment or lifestyle have impacted
the condition. A newly released paper published in The Lancet Diabetes &
Endocrinology examines whether any environmental exposures can explain why
Jill Norris, Professor and chair of epidemiology at the Colorado School of
Public Health and lead author of the paper said, “The incidence of type 1
diabetes has increased 3 percent per year over the past three decades. This
increase is too rapid to be due to just genetic factors, suggesting that
Identifying environmental factors associated with type 1 diabetes that
influence its incidence can inform future preventive trials and searches for
In this paper, researchers reviewed the literature on environmental factors
like air pollution, diet, childhood obesity, the duration of breastfeeding,
introduction of cow's milk, infections, and many other factors that showcase
The researchers then looked at prevalence of an exposure over time while
varying its annual increase under simulated scenarios. Using the simulated
data, the research showed that if a single factor were to explain the changes
in the incidence of type 1 diabetes over the past few decades, it would have
to be very strongly associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes.
The simulated scenarios showed that an environmental factor that increased at
a constant rate from nearly absent in the population to nearly ubiquitous
would have to confer a relative risk of 5 to explain an approximately 3
percent annual increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes. However, most of
the environmental factors reviewed had a relative risk of less than 2.
"While several factors have been associated with type 1 diabetes, none of the
associations are of a magnitude that can explain the rapid increase in
incidence alone," Norris said. "Moreover, evidence of the changing prevalence
of these same exposures over time is not convincing nor consistent."
The paper explains that more research is required, and it is possible that
multiple factors may simultaneously account for the increase in type 1
The study concludes that the identification of environmental factors
influencing type 1 diabetes risk and increased understanding of the etiology
at the individual level, regardless of the ability to explain the changing
incidence at the population level, is important because of the implications
