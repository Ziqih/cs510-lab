# Diabetes is relentless. But so are we.
Our vision is to create a world where diabetes can do no harm. And with more
and more people affected by diabetes, we have no choice but to fight harder
## One in 15 of us is now living with diabetes.
### Together, we have the opportunity to change this for the next generation.
There is hope now like never before, so the next five years are critical. By
2025, this is what we want to achieve:
* More people with type 1, type 2 and all other forms of diabetes will benefit from new treatments that cure or prevent the condition.
* More people will be in remission from type 2 diabetes.
* More people will get the quality of care they need to manage their diabetes well.
* Fewer people will get type 2 and gestational diabetes.
* More people will live better and more confident lives with diabetes, free from discrimination.
We know we can reach our vision, but we can only get there by working
We need your friends, family and colleagues. We need your time, your energy
and your fundraising. None of this will be possible without you.
## Look at what you've helped us achieve
Over the last five years, we've made impressive progress. We know every step
Diabetes can be relentless, but so can we. If you're feeling inspired, join us
now in creating a world where diabetes can do no harm.
