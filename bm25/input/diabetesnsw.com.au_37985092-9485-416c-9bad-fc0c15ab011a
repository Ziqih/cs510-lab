# Love Carbs But Not Their Effect On BGLs?
* Which way of cooking pasta will have a more dramatic effect on your blood glucose level - well-cooked or less cooked (al dente) pasta?
* Which way of preparing potatoes will release glucose into your bloodstream slower - potato salad kept in the fridge overnight or boiled potatoes served steaming hot from the pot?
Here we look at different ways of cooking carbs and the effect that can have
Pasta and potatoes are both carbohydrate foods. Carbohydrates break down into
glucose causing an increase in blood glucose levels. All carbohydrate foods
break down into glucose at a different rate. However, by simply changing the
way you cook and prepare some carbohydrate foods you can make a difference in
the rate of carbohydrate breakdown. The slower the breakdown the better for
The glycemic index (GI) is a scale that rates carbohydrate foods based on how
slowly or quickly they affect blood glucose levels. Carbohydrate foods with a
lower GI are more favourable for diabetes management. They take longer to
digest and therefore can increase your blood glucose level in a slower and
gentler manner. There are many factors that affect the GI of carbohydrate
food. In general, the foods that are less processed are lower in GI due to the
higher fibre content. For example, multigrain bread is lower in GI than white
bread. However, how you cook and prepare foods can also make a difference too.
When it comes to cooking pasta, overcooking boosts the GI. The best way to
have pasta is to cook it al dente (firm to the bite). Al dente pasta will take
longer to digest. That’s why less-cooked pasta is lower GI than well-cooked
pasta, and why al dente is better for diabetes management. When cooking try
the pasta two to three minutes before the indicated cooking time on the
packet. It should be slightly firm and offer some resistance when you are
chewing it. However, bear in mind that if you have too much in one go, it will
still have a considerable effect on your blood glucose level. Try adding
vegetables to your pasta or having some salad on the side to make a more
If you are a potato-lover living with diabetes, you can still enjoy potatoes
by swapping to the lower GI potatoes such GiLICIOUS or Carisma. However, you
can also make your potatoes lower in GI by changing the way you prepare them.
Cooling after cooking increases resistant starch in carbohydrate foods such as
potatoes, rice and pasta. Resistant starch is a type of fibre that cannot be
digested, which helps lower the GI of the food. It is recorded that cold
storage increases the potatoes' resistant starch content by more than a third.
Even better - toss your potatoes with any kind of vinaigrette (such as lemon
juice, lime juice or vinegar) as the acid in the vinaigrette will slow stomach
