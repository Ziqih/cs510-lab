There are two main things about diabetes that can affect your ability to drive
* If how you treat your diabetes means you’re at risk of having a hypo (where your blood sugar drops below 4mmol/l).
* If you develop diabetes complications that make it harder for you to drive – like problems with your eyes (retinopathy) or nerve damage (neuropathy).
If these things affect you, you need to know what the rules are and what you
need to tell your local driver and licensing authority.
The rules are different depending on what vehicle you want to drive. Here
we’ll talk mainly about what you need to know if you want to drive a car or
To drive a lorry or larger vehicle, you’ll need a Group 2 licence. There are
different rules for this type of licence and they can be more complicated when
These rules come from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in
England, Scotland and Wales, and the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in
Northern Ireland. We use **DVLA** throughout this information, to make things
And remember, you need to know these rules if these things could affect you in
## Driving and how you treat your diabetes
As we've said, if how you treat your diabetes means you're at risk of hypos,
then this can affect your ability to drive safely.
So what makes you at risk of having hypos? Hypos can affect people who take
certain medication to treat their diabetes, including insulin and medications
like sulphonylureas. And some hypos can be really severe where you need help
to treat them. Speak to your healthcare team if you’re not sure whether you’re
at risk of having these and what you can do to prevent them. If you already
know you're at risk of hypos, follow our checklist each and every time you
### However you treat your diabetes, use our table explaining the rules for
your driving licence based on each type of treatment.

Retinopathy is damage to the blood vessels supplying the eye’s retina (the
seeing part at the back of the eye) and it can cause sight loss. It’s linked
to high blood sugars and high blood pressure so it’s more common in people
If you start having problems with your eyes, you need to let the DVLA know and
you may need a special eye test. It’ll be done at an optician near you that’s
recommended by the DVLA and they’ll pay for it.
Some eye problems can be treated successfully which means you can reapply for
your licence. Ask your healthcare team if you’re not sure.
## Other diabetes complications that can affect driving
Neuropathy affects your nerves. Damage to your nerves can mean you lose
feeling in your hands and feet, as well as causing problems in various other
parts of your body. If it’s severe then you should ask your healthcare team or
If neuropathy or an amputation mean you need an adapted vehicle, you’ll have
to apply for an adapted vehicle licence from the DVLA.
Heart complications can affect your ability to drive and being able to hold a
licence. Your specialist heart team must advise you here.
Other conditions the DVLA need to know about include things that could cause
loss of consciousness or concentration, like sleep apnoea. This can make it
harder for you to concentrate in the day due to extreme sleepiness. Talk to
your healthcare team or sleep clinic about this.
They also need to know about any problems you develop that make it difficult
to negotiate traffic or act quickly. For example a stroke, which is a
cardiovascular complication, is when blood can't get to the brain and it's
starved of vital oxygen and nutrients. This can happen if your blood vessels
are damaged or blocked and can make it harder for you to react quickly.

## Your driving checklist if you’re at risk of hypos
Follow this checklist each and every time you drive. It’s how you reduce your
risk of a hypo at the wheel. And it’s how you can carry on driving safely.
* Know the symptoms of a hypo – if you’ve lost hypo awareness, you can’t drive. 
* Keep spare test strips in the car and bring your meter with you.
* Check your blood sugar levels before you set off and every two hours on long journeys.
* Five to drive – your blood sugars have to be 5mmol/l or above before you drive. If they’re between 4mmol/l and 5mmol/l, eat some carbs before heading out.
* If they’re under 4mmol/l – treat your hypo and check your levels again before driving.
* Always keep hypo treatments where you can easily reach them in the car.
Remember, the rules are more complicated if you want to drive a large vehicle,
## When to check blood sugar levels for driving
If you usually check your blood sugar levels, then you must follow the rules
about when to check them. This means checking them **within two hours of
driving** – however short the trip. On longer journeys, you must check them
It's fine to use a flash glucose monitor or a continuous glucose monitor to
These rules are only about checking for low blood sugar levels – the DVLA
don’t have any specific limits on high blood sugar levels.
Speak to your healthcare team if you’re not sure whether you should be
checking your blood sugars – it depends what medication you’re on.
## If you start having a hypo while driving
It’s the law that you must stop. And it’s what you must do to avoid any risk
of an accident. So find somewhere safe to pull in as soon as possible.
1. Pull over safely. If you feel like your blood sugar is low then make sure you pull over as soon as possible. 
2. Switch off the engine. Take the keys out and move from the driver’s seat – if you don’t, the police can think you’re still in charge of the car and you could be prosecuted.
3. Take fast-acting carbs, like glucose tablets or sweets, and some longer-acting carbohydrates too, like plain biscuits or crackers.
4. Don’t drive until 45 minutes after your blood sugar level has gone back to 5mmol/l or above. This is the time it takes for your concentration to go back to normal. 
If you’re struggling with hypos, talk to your healthcare team about whether
You don’t need to let the DVLA know that you’ve had a hypo – only if it’s a
severe hypo (where you need help to treat it). Severe hypos are a lot more
serious so the rules are more detailed. We have more information about severe
hypos if you don't know what they are.
Most car insurance companies won’t charge more if you have diabetes. You
should complain if they do and if you’re still not happy then try somewhere

insurance. We’ve information about insurance and diabetes to help you.
