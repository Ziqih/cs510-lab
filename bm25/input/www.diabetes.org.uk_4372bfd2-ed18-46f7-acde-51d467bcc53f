### Some people with diabetes can develop an unhealthy relationship or
fixation on food. This can lead to something called disordered eating
Diabetes and food are closely linked. Having diabetes can mean a bigger focus
on diet, weight and body image. So it’s not surprising that some people can
Disordered eating isn’t the same as having a diagnosed eating disorder. But
the signs and behaviours are similar, like skipping insulin for weight loss,
or binge eating and making yourself sick. But one can lead to the other, so
it’s really important you get help before things get worse.
These eating problems are more common than you think – you’re not alone in
this. And they can happen to anyone, not just because you have diabetes.

Here we’ll help you recognise disordered eating behaviour, find out what can
cause it and you’ll read how some people have overcome this.
## How to recognise an eating disorder with diabetes
If you’re worried that you have an eating problem, it’s important to know the
warning signs so you can get the right support at the right time. This
information is also for family members or friends who are worried someone they
know with diabetes is developing an eating disorder.
Here are some of the signs of disordered eating:
* binge eating (eating a lot of food very often and not feeling in control)
* trying to lose weight by making yourself sick or restricting insulin 
* exercising a lot without eating enough to balance it out.
Over time, disordered eating behaviours like this can lead to eating
disorders, like anorexia, bulimia or binge eating disorder.
We’ve put together some questions to help you think about your relationship
with eating. If you’re answering yes to some of these, it’s important that you

> you feel guilty or ashamed about what you’ve eaten?
> 2. Do you worry you’ve lost control over how much you eat?
> 3. Have you lost quite a lot of weight in the last few months?
> 4. Do you think you’re fat when others say you’re too thin?
> 5. If you take insulin to treat your diabetes, do you ever take less
Lots of people with diabetes have overcome these feelings and changed their
eating behaviours. We've put together some next steps for you to think about,
to get the support you need to overcome this.
Diabulimia is a serious eating disorder that only affects people with Type 1
diabetes. It’s when you reduce or stop taking insulin to lose weight. This is
really dangerous, and can cause serious damage now and in the future too.
Lynsey had diabulimia and is now recovered. In her video she talks about how
diabulimia affected her and how she overcame her eating disorder.

Binge eating is when you eat a lot of food in a short space of time. Some
people make themselves sick afterwards, but not everyone. This is a serious
eating problem and you need to be aware of the damage it can cause to your

## What can cause eating problems when you have diabetes?
Anyone can develop eating problems. They don’t just affect people with
How they start is complicated and can vary for different people. Some people
can feel depressed and binge eat for comfort, or some can get fixated with
* diabetes is taking over too much of your life
* pressured or controlled by others focusing on food
* fixated on blood sugar levels being perfect.
> “My family will say things like, ‘You shouldn’t eat that!’. They have no
> idea how hurtful that is to me. I know they’re just trying to help, but I
> wish they wouldn’t. It just makes me feel so inferior, so bad about myself.”

## How eating disorders can affect your body
Eating problems can seriously damage your body. This can affect you right now
Eating too much will make your blood sugar levels go too high. This is known
as hyperglycaemia – hypers can make you feel really tired and cause headaches.
Restricting insulin will also make your blood sugar levels go too high. And
this can quickly lead to a serious and life-threating complication called
diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA for short. You need emergency treatment for DKA.
Restricting insulin not only affects your blood sugars, it can also make you
lose weight. But losing too much weight can make your bones and muscles
weaker, which will affect how well you can get around.
If you’re making yourself sick to try and avoid putting on weight, you’re
affecting your mouth health too. There’s a lot of acid in vomit and this can
If you have high blood sugar levels over a long period of time, it can
seriously damage your blood vessels. Which can lead to complications in places
This might all sound scary or you might think these complications won’t happen
to you, but knowing what’s at stake could help you prevent more problems.
