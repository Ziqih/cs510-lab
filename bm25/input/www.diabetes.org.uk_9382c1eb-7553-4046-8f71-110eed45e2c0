>>>>>>> Research is at the heart of our mission to reach a world where
diabetes can do no harm. For 80 years, we've led the way in funding pioneering
research that changes lives. But we're not stopping here. Looking ahead to
2025 we're setting out our bold new plans for research.
>>>>>>> We co-created our strategy with people living with diabetes,
scientists and healthcare professionals, by working with the Diabetes Research
Steering Groups, to make sure it focuses on what matters most to them. These
groups bring people together to pinpoint specific areas in diabetes where we
don't yet know enough. They then plan how to change this by getting research
off the ground to fill the gaps in our knowledge.
>>>>>>> Our strategy lays out research priorities that the Diabetes Research
Steering Groups have told us urgently need addressing.
>>>>>>> We will keep the Diabetes Research Steering Group's priorities at the
very forefront of our work and direct our funding towards those areas that
will best help us achieve the change we want to see by 2025:
>>>>>>> 1. More people with or at risk of type 1, type 2 and all
other forms of diabetes will benefit from new treatments that cure or prevent
>>>>>>> 2. More people will be in remission from type 2 diabetes.
>>>>>>> 3. More people will get the quality of care they need to
>>>>>>> 4. Fewer people will get type 2 and gestational diabetes.
>>>>>>> 5. More people will live better and more confident lives
>>>>>>> Breakthroughs in all of these outcomes are within touching distance.
And with our research strategy driving us to be even more effective, more
innovative and more focused on what matters most to people living with
diabetes, we can make our ambitions a reality.

research.** We’ll support innovative thinking and help kick-start new areas of
exploration to move even faster towards ending the harm diabetes does.
>>>>>>> * **Bring people living with and working in diabetes
together to make change happen.** We’ll make sure we listen to a diverse range
of people and put their views at the heart of our research.

protect people with or at risk of diabetes - has been brought into sharp focus

>>>>>>> * We fund personal awards to help talented scientists and
healthcare professionals become the diabetes research leaders of the future.
>>>>>>> * We make targeted investments to support research in
specific areas where there are important gaps or opportunities.
>>>>>>> In each case, our rigorous approach ensures that the research we fund
is of the highest scientific quality and has the greatest potential to benefit
people living with or at risk of diabetes.
>>>>>>> We offer support to scientists and healthcare professionals working at
universities and hospitals throughout the UK. Our funding pays for salaries as
well as the equipment and materials needed to carry out diabetes research.

around the world for their feedback on each application we receive. The
experts consider the feasibility, cost-effectiveness and likely success of

would make the biggest difference to people with the condition.

discuss each application and decide which projects should be awarded funding.
They draw on scientists’ reviews, the priorities assigned by our Grants
Advisory Panel and the applications themselves to reach their decisions. We
