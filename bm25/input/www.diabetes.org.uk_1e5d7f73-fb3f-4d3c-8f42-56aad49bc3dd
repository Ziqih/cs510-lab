# Type 1 diabetes in children: How your child may react to their diagnosis
For teens and children with Type 1, the actual time of their diabetes
diagnosis is often a confusing and frightening blur. They have a memory of
feeling ill, being suddenly taken to hospital and waking up on a drip,
surrounded by various medical staff and anxious parents. It may all seem like
Diabetes, though, can’t be forgotten. Unlike the usual illnesses of childhood,
Type 1 diabetes won’t ever go away. When the child slowly realises this
they’re naturally both frightened and upset. They may long for it to be
yesterday, or last week – to return to the way things were before.
All people – and families – have different ways of coping with things, and
children are likely to copy the way that their parents cope. After the
physical and emotional shock of a diagnosis of diabetes, expecting a child to
deal with things quickly and practically isn’t helpful. This shock and the way
their life has changed need to be acknowledged and talked about, allowing them
No one knows precisely what the child has gone through, and they may not be
able or have the words to explain it. They may blame themselves, or see their
diabetes as a punishment for something. It’s a good idea to let them express
their fears and emotions now, as these won’t simply disappear – and even if
they lie buried they may re-emerge at a later date – maybe in their teens or
Some children with Type 1 diabetes may choose to minimise their difficulties,
preferring not to mention it, ignore it or play it down. Everyone finds their
own way of coping, and some children may cope better than others. Be aware,
though, that a child who seems to be coping very well may be hiding their true
After a loss – and this is a loss – people naturally go through a period of
grief and mourning. This process takes time, but is necessary for recovery and
for getting used to a new and difficult way of life. How long it takes depends
on the individual and how much support, both emotional and physical, is
available. Allow children to grieve in their own way, and don’t try to hurry
One way to help a child through this difficult time is to let them talk openly
to someone who’ll listen and understand. Having Type 1 diabetes is often a
lonely business, and having the support and understanding of family and
friends can be a great source of strength.
Many children (especially older children) find it difficult to talk about
their diabetes – as indeed do many adults. They may find it easier to talk to
someone outside their immediate family – like a grandparent or best friend. It
can also help an older child to keep a daily journal to say how the day was,
what was especially difficult and what was good.
Young children with diabetes need comfort, cuddles and calm handling. If your
child’s diabetes diagnosis comes when they’re very young, be aware that
problems may emerge when they’re older – often when school starts and your
child realises that their life is different to those of other children.
## Tips for teens and older children with diabetes
* Diabetes – and those who live with it – deserve respect. Give it, and expect it.
* Try to acknowledge privately and publicly that it’s difficult, but also that you have the strength to handle it.
* Try to work out a relationship with your diabetes that isn’t destructive. It can’t be the enemy if it’s part of you, if you live with it.
* Think of your diabetes as a difficult relative who you care for – sometimes it’s easy, sometimes it’s frustrating – and sometimes it’s infuriating. At times you’ll cope really well; at others you won’t. Be kind to yourself – you’re only human.
There’s no need for a child with Type 1 diabetes to stop doing anything their
friends do. But there can be difficulties on the way and these need to be
