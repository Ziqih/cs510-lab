Queensland University of Technology have developed “smart egg-carton” packages
for transporting live human pancreas cells for transplantation to patients
living with diabetes. The egg-cartons provide oxygen and allow physical
separation to prevent damage and death to the cells – known as islet cells –
Besides a whole pancreas transplant (which has a high mortality rate),
currently the only cure for diabetes is islet cell transplantation. It’s a
procedure available to patients with complicated type 1 diabetes.
Although hundreds of patients have successfully received donor islet cells,
the rates of cell survival and effective transplantation would be vastly
improved if more cells survived the initial removal and transport phases. Our
In a patient suffering from type 1 diabetes, the pancreas is not able to
produce insulin, the hormone responsible for glucose metabolism. As a result,
these patients need to constantly monitor their blood glucose levels, and
adjust these with insulin injections throughout the day.
Instability in blood glucose levels has significant implications for the
patient’s health in the long term, mainly due to changes in very small blood
vessels that lead to diseases of the eye, kidney, nerves and cardiovascular

Normally, insulin is produced by β-cells (pronounced as “beta cells”). β-cells
exist in the pancreas in a packed group of cells called the “islets of
Langerhans”, or islets for short. Along with the β-cells, other cells within
the islet also produce unique and specific hormones. Together these cells act
The idea of transplanting healthy islets to diabetic patients became a reality
in the late 1980s, when Dr Camilo Ricordi devised a workable method for
isolating the required amounts of these cells. Now with improvements in anti-
rejection drug therapy, islet transplantation is used to treat type 1
diabetes: hundreds of patients worldwide have received a transplant.

Islet transplantation requires a single keyhole surgery to precisely position
the islets within the patient’s abdomen, and a quick recovery usually follows.
Like any transplantation, islet transplantation is hamstrung by the small
number of organ donors and an increasing population suffering from diabetes
But there’s another limiting factor - once separated from the pancreas, islets
are extremely fragile and up to 35% will perish before being transplanted.
Improving the survival of islets pre-transplantation is expected to
dramatically improve the availability and clinical outcomes for patients.

The number of transplants varies year to year due to the number of donors

When a pancreas is collected from a donor, a specific procedure is required to
extract the islets located within the pancreas. This isolation can only be
performed in a sterile facility (protected from contamination) equipped with
In Australia, like in other countries, the isolation is centralised in
Melbourne and Sydney and the islets are then shipped to the different
transplantation centres. But because islets are composed of cells with a very
high rate of metabolism, they need a lot of nutrients and oxygen. Without
these, the cells won’t generate insulin and the other hormones used in the
Once disconnected from the blood vessels in the host person, islets quickly
begin to starve and asphyxiate, both of which lower chances of cell survival.
Many laboratories around the world are trying to extend the shelf-life of
islets. The team have developed two brand new technologies to address the
causes of islet death during transport – provision of oxygen, and protection
The first development is an inexpensive coating that releases oxygen once in
contact with the islets. Researchers have shown the coating can provide enough
oxygen for animal β-cells to survive in a low-oxygen environment (as is
encountered during transport). They are hoping to soon translate this
But this is not the only challenge: the movement of islets during transport
can also cause damage. Currently, islets are transported in bags where the
islets are freely floating in a solution composed of the required cell
nutrients. As the bags move, islets are shaken and bounce onto each other.
After trying different biomaterials and testing several packaging shapes,
researchers developed an egg-carton-like packaging. This segregates the
spherical islets from each other, and maintains their viability during

scanning electron microscopy. Sitting within the wells of the “egg carton” are
This technology has been used to successfully transportanimal and human
islet cells between Melbourne and Adelaide by plane, which took on average six
hours from door to door. The egg-carton package improved islet survival.
Translating this technology to the clinic will hopefully improve islet
survival during shipping, and give access to islet transplantation to a larger
population. This technology needs now to be scaled up to accommodate the
But a bigger challenge remains: improving the long-term survival of islets
after transplantation. New biomaterials and advanced engineering solutions
could also help tackle this issue, including the development of scaffolds that
enhance delivery of nutrients and oxygen access from the blood vessel to the
In the words of collaborator Bernie Tuch at the University of Sydney:
_Advanced medical devices made of biocompatible materials which could protect
the islets after implantation could further improve the transplantation
procedure and allow more patients to benefit from this treatment_
