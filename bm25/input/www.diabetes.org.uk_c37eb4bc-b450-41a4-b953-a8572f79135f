# NHSE statistics on coronavirus deaths in people with diabetes
Updated 14 January: We now know more detail about the people with diabetes who
have died from coronavirus in hospitals in England, between March and May
2020. We’ve broken down the new data for you here.
A study from NHS England revealed that one in three people (33.2%) who have
died in hospital in England following a diagnosis of coronavirus also had
diabetes. We know this statistic raised a lot more questions than it did
answers, and it may have left you feeling increasingly worried.
NHS England looked at data about the specific groups of people with diabetes
who are at a greater risk of dying if they catch coronavirus. So we now know
much more detail about the people with diabetes who sadly died in hospitals in
## What the latest coronavirus statistics tell us
This data shows that, for those who become so unwell with coronavirus that
they need to go to hospital, the risk of dying is higher for people living
with diabetes than people without the condition. But it’s vital to remember
that for most people the overall risk is still very low and will reduce even
If you have diabetes, you are no more likely to catch coronavirus than anyone
else. And the majority of people who do get coronavirus – whether they have
diabetes or not – will have mild symptoms and don’t need to go into hospital.
This new data gives us more information about the people with diabetes who
have died from coronavirus, including their age and the type of diabetes they
had. The data also shows there are other risk factors involved – like weight
The most important thing anyone with diabetes can do is try their best to
manage their condition carefully, keep their blood sugar in range as much as
Here's our Head of Research Communications, Lucy Chambers, to explain a bit
The factor most strongly related to risk of death from coronavirus is older
age. We know that very few people with diabetes under the age of 50 have died
This is consistent with what we know about the impact of coronavirus on the
general population, with those who are older more likely to experience a
poorer outcome. This is like other illnesses – such as pneumonia – where you
are more likely to have a serious illness as you age.
So older adults with diabetes in particular should follow stringent social
distancing measures to reduce their chances of catching the virus altogether.

These figures only look at the number of people who have died in hospital as a
result of coronavirus, and don’t consider the many thousands who have
recovered at home or who have been successfully discharged from hospital.
The new data shows us that of the 23,804 deaths recorded in the study, 7,466
(31.3%) who died from coronavirus had type 2 diabetes, 365 (1.5%) had type 1
diabetes and 69 (0.3%) had other types. The majority of people (66%) didn’t
It’s important to remember about 90% of people with diabetes have type 2. And
the majority of people with type 2 are aged over 60, and we know age is
strongly linked to death from coronavirus. So overall, there have been more
deaths recorded in people with type 2 diabetes.
But when we look at it proportionally – and take into account differences
between people such as their age, sex and ethnicity – even though there were
fewer deaths in type 1 diabetes, the condition itself is linked with a higher
risk. People with type 1 diabetes were found to be 3.5 times more likely to
die, and people with type 2 diabetes twice as likely to die, than people who
don’t have diabetes when in hospital with coronavirus.

While the reason for this is not fully understood, social and economic factors
may play a significant role. It is clear we need further research to
## What can I do to reduce my risk?
The data also shows there are other risk factors which can put you at an
increased risk of poorer outcomes if you catch coronavirus – including weight
and if you have a history of high blood sugar levels and complications.
We’re not sure why this increases the risk, but it may be that people with
higher blood sugar levels have higher levels of inflammation inside their
body, which affects how our immune system reacts to coronavirus. Diabetes
complications can damage blood vessels, and this could potentially make it
easier for coronavirus to travel around and affect the body. And obesity can
increase your risk of developing infections and makes it harder for your body
This means it’s really important that you continue to manage your condition
carefully, and keep your blood sugar levels within your target range as much
We know that managing what you eat and how much you exercise can be difficult
when you have diabetes, but now it is more important to do what you can to
keep yourself safe. And managing weight isn’t simple for everyone, but we have
lots of advice and support to help you.
Although this new data has provided us with a lot more detail about the
potential risks of coronavirus infection for people with diabetes, it is
important to recognise that the risk of death from coronavirus remains very
low for people with and without diabetes, and that it will continue to
As always, we’ll continue to review the emerging evidence and data that is
published to ensure we’re sharing the most up to date information with you.
## What does the UK Government need to do?
The government needs to urgently review all of the emerging evidence and data
about the risks to people with diabetes, to inform their policies around
social distancing, employment guidance, and any measures around easing
Most importantly, the government must ensure that their policies consider the
specific needs and individual risks of people with diabetes, so that they are
protected and supported, and provided with clear and consistent advice on
