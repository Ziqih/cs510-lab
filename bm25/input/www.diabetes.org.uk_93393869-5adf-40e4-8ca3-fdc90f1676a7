## Welcome to your Type 1 diabetes: Make the grade campaign.
Type 1 diabetes: Make the grade is campaigning to make sure all children with
Type 1 diabetes get the support and care that they deserve at school so that
they are safe, happy and have equal opportunities at school.
We know good care is possible because we’re seeing it happen, and we want to
make sure it happens right across the UK. We know many schools and families
need a helping hand, that’s why with your help we are working together with
children, parents and carers, schools, healthcare professionals and the
Government to achieve great care for all children with Type 1.
Together we are campaigning to raise awareness to make sure that all schools
make the grade for children and young people living with Type 1 diabetes.

We think schools that give good care deserve an award. And that’s what we’ve
been doing up and down the country since we launched the Good Diabetes Care in
School Award just over a year ago. We’ve given the Award to over 130 schools.

## Practical help for school residential trips and exams
Schools and parents have often told us that planning school residential trips
and exams are stressful at the best of times, let alone when the needs of
children with Type 1 diabetes come into play. We say that there is no reason
for children and young people with Type 1 to miss out on residential school
trips or not achieve their best at exams. And in England it’s also been a

residential trips and exams, we’ve designed interactive tools that outline
good practice and rights and responsibilities. They can be fully personalised

and exams. We encourage your school to download this tool and put it into
## Talking about Type 1 diabetes in school
Supporting a child with Type 1 diabetes is not just about day-to-day care, it
is also important to educate staff and students so that they understand the
condition. Dispelling myths, fears and misconceptions is often half the
battle. Ensuring that staff and other students understand and are supportive
can make a huge difference to a child living with diabetes. We’ve made it easy
for schools to raise awareness with our three bespoke presentations for
schools. These come with easy to follow presentation notes and you don’t need
to be an expert on diabetes to use them. They are perfect for use at school
## Why not hear it from the young people themselves?
We have 21 fabulous student films made by children and young people with
diabetes as part of our Diabetes in School Short Film competition. These
inspirational films throw light on common misconceptions about Type 1
diabetes, explain how diabetes impacts school life and shows that diabetes
does not stop people doing the things they love from gymnastics to hockey. All
21 films are available for use by schools to help to raise awareness of Type 1
diabetes and what good care at school should look like.
