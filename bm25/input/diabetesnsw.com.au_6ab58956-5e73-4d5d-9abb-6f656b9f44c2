# Test could predict children who will develop type 1
UK and US researchers said up to 75 percent of cases of type 1 diabetes could
be diagnosed by scouring the blood for biomarkers of the condition.
The average child is in their mid-teens by the time they are diagnosed with
type 1 diabetes, by which time many have developed dangerous symptoms.
In the UK, heel-prick tests are already used to check for nine rare but
serious conditions, including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease.
Scientists from the University of Exeter and the Pacific Northwest Research
Institute in Seattle, who did the study, are pushing for diabetes to be
They are currently analysing their test in clinical trials at hospitals in
For the latest study, researchers drew on data from the Environmental
Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) Study.
The TEDDY study followed 7,798 children at high risk of developing type 1
The researchers analysed the children’s records and found that children who
developed the condition had large amounts of islet autoantibodies, biomarkers
that appear when the pancreas is damaged, in their body.
They said they were able to use this approach to 'dramatically improve
prediction of which children would develop Type 1 diabetes'.
Type 1 diabetes is caused when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to
It's different from type 2 diabetes, which is a progressive condition where
the pancreas is either not producing enough insulin or the insulin you are
producing is not working effectively. It has been linked to obesity and a poor
lifestyle which includes lack of exercise and poor diet.
Type 1 diabetes is much less common than type 2, affecting approximately 10
As many as four in 10 children with type 1 diabetes suffer ketoacidosis, when
acidic substances called ketones build up to dangerous levels in the blood.
Although there are preventive treatments, they are rarely used because it is
difficult to determine which children are at highest risk until diabetes
manifests itself - by which time it's too late.
## How the study will help diagnosis and treatment
Identifying which children are at highest risk will also benefit clinical
trials on drugs that are showing promise in preventing the condition, the
Dr Lauric Ferrat at the University of Exeter Medical School, said: 'At the
moment, 40 percent of children who are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes have the
'For the very young this is life-threatening, resulting in long intensive
hospitalisations and in some cases even paralysis or death.
'Using our new combined approach to identify which babies will develop
diabetes can prevent these tragedies, and ensure children are on the right
treatment pathway earlier in life, meaning better health.'
Professor William Hagopian of the Pacific Northwest Research Institute, said:
'They suggest that the routine heel prick testing of babies done at birth,
could go a long way towards preventing early sickness as well as predicting
which children will get type 1 diabetes years later.
'We're now putting this to the test in a trial in Washington State. We hope it
will ultimately be used internationally to identify the condition as early as
possible, and to power efforts to prevent the disease.'
