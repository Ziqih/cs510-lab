German scientists have, for the first time, identified six different types of
Pre-diabetes is a condition that precedes the onset of type 2 diabetes.
The research, tracking data from a 25 year-long study, suggests the new
subtypes of pre-diabetes will help doctors more precisely identify people most
As blood glucose levels rise doctors can diagnose patients with pre-diabetes,
when their levels are consistently higher than normal. But not high enough to
Not everyone with pre-diabetes goes on to develop type 2 diabetes.
For some these increased blood glucose levels can be relatively harmless, with
no symptoms, but for others pre-diabetes can be an early sign of serious
## Is pre-diabetes a precursor to type 2 diabetes?
“Until now it has not been possible to predict whether someone with pre-
diabetes would develop type 2 diabetes and be at risk of serious
complications. Or whether they would only have slightly higher blood glucose
levels but without significant risk," explains Hans-Ulrich Häring, from the
The new research, analyzed 25 years of data from 900 subjects taking part in a
Using cluster analysis the research homed in on six different pre-diabetes
"The study showed that there are different disease types in the preliminary
stage of diabetes. Each type differs in blood glucose levels, insulin action
and insulin secretion, body fat distribution, liver fat and genetic risk,"
notes Robert Wagner, author on the new study.
Each of the six pre-diabetes subtypes found in the study is distinguished by
specific metabolic parameters and result in different long-term outcomes.
Three subtypes (clusters 1, 2 and 4) are the healthier types of pre-diabetes.
These subjects present as generally healthy. Cluster 4, for example,
encompasses overweight subjects with broadly healthy metabolic markers.
Clusters 3, 5 and 6 were linked to the highest risk of developing type 2
diabetes and secondary diseases. Cluster 5 grouped those subjects with
pronounced fatty liver, while cluster 3 grouped those who produced
To further validate these six subtypes, the researchers examined data from
another longitudinal study. Called Whitehall II, the UK study tracked the
metabolic health of nearly 10,000 subjects for over 20 years.
They found the six pre-diabetes subtypes accurately fit that large dataset,
confirming pre-diabetes can be distinguished into separate disease
## What this means for future diabetes treatment
Researchers suggest more work is needed before the findings can be used by

“The combination of in-depth research with state-of-the-art bioinformatics has
made this important result possible. The identification of subtypes is an
important step towards precision medicine in the prevention of diabetes and
