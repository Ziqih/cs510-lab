Microwave cooking was discovered by accident just after WW2 by a radar
engineer who noticed that a chocolate bar in his pocket had melted. Originally
called ‘Radaranges’, they first appeared in British kitchens in the mid-1970s.
They were voted, in a recent BBC Good Food survey, as the UK’s favourite
kitchen gadget and figures from the Office of National Statistics estimate 92
per cent of us now have at least one.
Are we all just using them to reheat cooked food or drinks or for making a
quick jacket potato? Perhaps – but they can do so much more and save you money
If you have diabetes (or not) and fancy a quick, healthy snack in minutes,
microwaving a meal in a mug could be the answer. Here we show you how and give
1. Cut foods into even-sized small pieces, they will cook more quickly than large ones.
2. Arrange foods so that they cook evenly. Face the thickest parts, like broccoli stalks, outward towards the oven walls. Microwaves cook from the outside in.
3. Cover dishes with microwave-safe clingfilm and always pierce the film before cooking.
4. Stir, turn, and rotate foods frequently during cooking to ensure heat is distributed evenly. Do this even if your microwave plate rotates during cooking.
5. Allow cooked food to rest for a minute or two after the cooking time. This ensures the heat is evenly distributed through the food.
6. Pierce foods that have skins, such as sweet potatoes or whole apples, to allow steam to escape.
7. Use the defrost power setting to ensure that foods defrost in a slow and even manner. To assist with even defrosting, turn and rotate the food every so often. Be aware that defrosting on full power, rather than the defrost setting, may result in raw, still-frozen areas in the food even though some parts may be piping hot.
8. Don't use metal or foil as it reflects microwaves and may cause sparks to fly.

When you microwave, you don't need to add fat to your food, which is great
news if you're managing your weight. When microwaving items such as vegetables
in water, as with traditional boiling, nutrients are lost into the water, so
it's important not to overcook or use too much water.
Microwaves use far less energy than traditional cooking methods, mainly due to
the speed at which they cook. Estimates vary, but you could save up to £5 a
Molecules of water in food are agitated by microwaves which makes them
generate heat. Microwaves can pass through plastic, glass and ceramic
containers and into the food. Metal containers reflect the microwaves and can
cause sparks, so are not suitable. Only use containers that are labelled
Remember, the more in volume you microwave the longer it takes. For example,
with conventional cooking, boiling 4 portions of broccoli takes the same time
as cooking one portion, but in a microwave 1 portion takes 1-2 minutes while 4
portions require 2-3 minutes, depending on the power of your microwave.
Microwaves do not always cook evenly and sometimes leave cold spots, which
could harbour bacteria, while a hot spot could burn you. This is why it's
really important to stir or move food around when cooking or reheating it, to
ensure an even distribution of heat. Also, letting food stand or rest for a
minute or two after cooking allows heat to distribute evenly through the dish.
Again, be sure to give your food a good stir
Many people only use their microwave for defrosting and reheating leftovers,
but you can cook a whole host of things from quick snacks to gourmet treats.
For example, broccoli, purple sprouting, carrots, Brussels sprouts and
cauliflower cook well in the microwave. Simply place in a microwave-proof bowl
and cover with microwave-safe cling film. Prick the cling film with the point
of a knife and microwave on full power (800watts) for 2-2 ½ minutes then leave
to stand for 1 minute. (1000 watt microwaves will take slightly less cooking
