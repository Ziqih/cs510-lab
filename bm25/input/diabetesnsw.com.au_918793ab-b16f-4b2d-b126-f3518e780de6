# Overcoming skin barriers to CGM and FGM
Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and flash glucose monitoring (FGM)
is becoming the standard of care for people with type 1 diabetes.
However, it’s reported about 20 percent of users discontinue using their
Issues with skin irritation and skin complications need to be addressed as
this can become a barrier and a reason why people discontinue using these
The number of users that experience some form of skin issues because of CGM
and FGM use has been reported in studies as 60 percent1 to 80 percent2 of
paediatric and young adult users. In adults, one in three adults presents with
Issues raised amongst users of CGM and FGM include:
* Poor adhesion - due to the sensor not staying stuck on due to swimming, living in humid conditions, sweating and being an athlete2.
* Skin reactions from adhesives - reactions often include itchy skin, eczema and wounds2.
* Skin reactions from the filament or small canula inserted.
Correct preparation of the insertion site for the sensor is important to
achieve good adhesion of the device. This includes:
* washing hands and the site with soap and water;
* not applying lotions to the site where the sensor will be inserted;
* and preparing the area with an alcohol wipe. Allow the area to cool and dry before inserting the sensor2,4,5.
When applying any skin preparation solution to the skin, it should be applied
in a donut formation (a circle with a hole in the middle) leaving a small
circle bare at the centre of the skin so you can insert the sensor only
through skin that has been prepped with alcohol.
To prepare the skin for application of a CGM or FGM, some studies have
reported the use of solid or sprayed antiperspirant when there is an issue
The antiperspirant is applied in a thin layer to the skin, waiting 10 to 15
minutes, then wiping away any excess and prepare the site for sensor
Products to protect the skin from irritation once the sensor is inserted
include liquid barriers which are wiped on or sprayed on and allowed to dry.
Some products may enhance adhesion of the sensor to the skin by making the
skin tacky2,5. Liquid barriers and products available in Australia are:
Always apply using a donut formation (a circle with a hole in the middle) and
allow the liquid product to dry before insertion of the sensor.
Barrier patches are a thin film or tape that are applied to the skin and under
This provides the skin with a protective barrier from the sensor adhesive.
It’s recommended to leave a hole in the barrier film where the sensor canula
These same products may be applied over the sensor to keep the sensor in
Use of barrier patches between the skin and the sensor may not have been
tested by manufacturers of your CGM and FGM. Contact your manufacturer or
health care team if the use of barrier films are appropriate for you and your
Removal of the sensor adhesive or barrier film is recommended in a “low and
slow” approach2. This requires removing the adhesive slowly, at a low angle
Adhesive remover wipes are applied on the adhesive and rubbed under the skin
towards the adhesive (as it is gently lifted) to aid with removal of the
* Household oils such as olive oil or baby oil.
Addressing skin hypersensitivity is one of the biggest challenges to help
maintain the integrity of skin while wearing CGM and FGM devices.
Topical corticosteroids creams and sprays are used to address this issue. Use
of such creams are not recommended under sensors or barrier film.
Topical corticosteroids creams are used to reduce inflammation and itch of
unbroken skin, and have been reported to improve the skin in 77% of CGM users1
A product that is being researched in this use is off-label steroid nasal
spray containing fluticasone, with the puff/spray applied to the skin and
allowed to dry prior to application of any barrier film or the sensor
Use of nasal sprays topically is currently acknowledge by one study as a way
that users of CGM and FGM are protecting the skin from adverse effects2.
However, long term use of these nasal sprays is off-label and it’s currently
unknown if there are any risks with long-term application on the skin.
Remember, everyone’s skin type is different and users of CGM and FGM need to
trial products to find one suitable to your needs.
When inserting your sensor, the filament or canula should only be inserted
through clean dry skin which has been prepped with an alcohol wipe.
If you are having issues with your sensor sites and skin irritations, talk to
your health care team or the manufacturer of your device to find suitable
