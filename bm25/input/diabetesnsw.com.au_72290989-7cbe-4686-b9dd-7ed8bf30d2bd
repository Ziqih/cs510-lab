When you have diabetes, self-monitoring helps you see the effects of food,
exercise, medication and illness on your blood glucose levels (BGLs).
It gives you the opportunity to check in with your body, which then will help
***Physical activity** (before, during and 24-28 hrs after exercise)
***Medications** especially when you start or change medication
***Driving** (Road and Maritime Service recommendation is to have a blood glucose level above 5 to drive)
Nowadays we have more options thanks to technology:
Understanding your blood glucose levels can help in the early detection and
correction of diabetes-related complications. Keeping BGLs within target range
How often you monitor and your target range is highly individualised and
depends on many factors. In the table below are some general recommendations
but you still need to speak with your health team to find out what is the best
## How often to test and target levels
 **Frequency of monitoring**|Check before and two hours after meals. At
bedtime and during the night if concern about overnight hypoglycaemia.
 | Monitoring may not be required for everyone. Frequency depends of type of
medications and potential side effects. Also, the agreement between you and
your health team.| Check four or more times a day, depending on your
In pregnancy glycaemic control is tighter to prevent any complications for
Two hours after meals less than 10mmol/L (from FIRST mouthful)| Fasting
Two hours after meals 6-10mmol/L (from FIRST mouthful)
Two hours after meals <6.7mmol/L (from FIRST mouthful)
1. Wash your hands in warm soapy water and dry well
2. Get your meter, strips, tissue and sharp container
6. Repeat if error or not enough blood
Note: It’s better to prick the side of the fingertip. Glucose reaches your
fingertip faster than other sites so it is not advisable to use alternative
sites, especially in cases of low blood glucose level.
If you suspect the reading is wrong, follow these steps:
* Make sure you wash your hands before testing
* Check your strips aren't damaged or out of date
* Consider whether the meter could have been affected by a change in temperature or humidity
* Does your meter need to be cleaned?
* Did you use the same strip more than once?
* Are you using the correct strip for your meter?
* It doesn’t measure the blood but it measures the interstitial fluid (fluid in the tissue) through a sensor attached to the back of your upper arm. Readings taken from interstitial fluid have a time lag of five to 10 minutes from a reading using a blood glucose meter.
Continuous glucose monitoring is a means of measuring glucose levels
continuously in order to gain insight into patterns and trends in glucose
A CGM sensor is inserted under the skin and measures the level of glucose in
the interstitial fluid. The sensor is disposable and changed according to
A transmitter wirelessly sends the information to a monitor or smart phone.
* Alarm when BGL is too high or too low
* Some models can send information to second person's smartphone
The HbA1c blood test reflects the average blood glucose level over the last
10-12 weeks. It’s recommended that you have this test done at least every 12
months, although you may be advised to have it done more often (every three to
six months). The results of an HbA1c check can help give you an overall
picture of your blood glucose management. The target HbA1c for most people is
7% or less. Your doctor will advise you of the right target for you.
