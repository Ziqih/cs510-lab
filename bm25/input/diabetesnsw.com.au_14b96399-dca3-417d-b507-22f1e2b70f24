Are you living with diabetes and planning to fast? Diabetes Educator and
Accredited Practising Dietitian Shannon Lin, and Accredited Practising

The decision to fast is personal, and your health care team has a duty of care
to respect your commitment and ensure your safety.
Fasting, refraining from using medications, insulin and drinking water affects
your blood glucose levels (BGL) and can lead to potential risks including high
BGL (hyperglycaemia), low BGL (hypoglycaemia or hypo), dehydration, blood
You may be advised not to fast if your diabetes management is unstable prior
to Ramadan, you have type 1 diabetes, you’re hypo unaware, pregnant, unwell,
“It is very important to discuss your Ramadan plan with your doctor and
diabetes team one to two months before,” advises Lin.
A pre-Ramadan assessment is an opportunity to review your blood pressure, BGL
and lipids, learn of any potential risks of fasting, discuss monitoring and
how to treat a hypo or manage high BGL, and prescribe any Ramadan-specific
changes in the dose and/or timing of your medication or insulin regime.
“A hypo is a medical emergency and therefore, treatment would entail breaking
your fast,” says Breik. Visiting your doctor to adjust your insulin regime
before you begin fasting can help you avoid this.
 **Safety tip:** Never stop taking your insulin or your diabetes medications.
Speak with your diabetes doctor or nurse about how to change the time and dose
“Your blood glucose levels can be affected by fasting, dehydration, prayer

and be prepared to break the fast to treat a hypo (BGL less than 4mmol/L) – or
“During the month of Ramadan, a person’s eating pattern endures a major
change,” explains Breik. Longer gaps between meals and feasting after iftar
can lead to greater swings in blood glucose levels.
“Proper nutrition is very important to help prevent any health problems that
may arise from inappropriate food choices or overeating.”
Here’s her top four tips for a healthier Ramadan:
“Break your fast with a ‘sunset snack’ of two dates, a cup of water and a bowl
of soup,” says Breik. Two dates are a good serve size (½ carbohydrate
exchange) and they are a low GI choice. “This is a Prophetic tradition and
will provide an instant energy boost and hydration to help settle your hunger
“Make sure you drink as much fluid, preferably water, as possible,” says
Breik. “A good technique to help you remember your fluids is to “drink two by
the hour” – meaning two cups of water (250mls = 1 cup). Five hours past
sunset, you would have consumed two and a half litres of fluid keeping you
Using the healthy plate model for your main meal will help you maintain a good
balance of carbohydrates (quarter of your plate), protein (quarter of your
plate) and vegetables (half a plate), and prevents you from overeating.
“Two hours after the dinner meal, it is normal to feel hungry,” explains
Breik. To appease your hunger and prevent overeating traditional sweets and
high BGLs after eating, choose one or two healthy options:
