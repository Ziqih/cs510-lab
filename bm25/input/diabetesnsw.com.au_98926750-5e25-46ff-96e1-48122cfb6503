11 level tablespoons SPLENDA® Low Calorie Sweetener Granular
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (170°C Fan).
2. Sift the flour and ground ginger into a bowl. Rub in margarine until it resembles breadcrumbs.
3. Stir in the SPLENDA® Granular making sure that it is evenly distributed in the mixture.
4. Add the apple puree, vanilla essence and egg yolk, cutting through using a knife, then bring together to form a soft dough, using your fingers or a spoon.
5. Lightly flour a work surface and roll the dough to 1/2cm thick and use a gingerbread man cutter to make approximately 12 men. Place on a non-stick baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, until golden. Cool on the tray.
6. Store in an airtight container for 1-2 days.
You can swap your traditional gingerbread man cookie cutter for something
slightly more festive such as a star or tree, but remember that this may alter
the serving size and hence the nutrition information. Always consider your own
