# Simple swaps to lower your kj count
Eating more and moving less does lead to weight gain. At the same time very
strict diets are not the answer as they can play havoc with our hormones and
hunger levels. They can also deprive our body of important nutrients.
When cutting back the kilojoules, ensure that you do it in a way that is safe
and sustainable. In many cases it doesn’t have to be big changes, it just has
to be consistent. For example, if you cut out a beer or a can of soft drink
each day, you could lose 7kg over a year. Imagine the benefits a few extra
swaps could add to this! Try swapping some of these kilojoule-dense options
