the impact diabetes could have on pregnancy outcomes.
>>>>>>> Information Prescriptions are a short (single side of A4), easy to

Information Prescription into their systems. The tool will then pop up for
relevant patients, significantly increasing the speed and effectiveness of the
intervention as key patient data is automatically populated and saved on the
medical record to support continuity of care. Until they’re live in the
