# 12-25 year olds wanted for hybrid closed-loop trial
Year 11 student Phillip Baker had a very good reason to get involved in
diabetes research — learn how to get his blood glucose levels under control or
The 16-year-old, from St Marys, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he
was six, said he had always struggled to manage his blood sugars, which, due
to medical restrictions, meant he was unable to apply for his learner’s
“My HBA1c had gone too high (9 percent) in the two months prior to me being
old enough to get my learner’s permit so I had to get that under control
“I had to wait until my HBA1c was down.”
Phillip recently completed the six-month Hybrid Closed-Loop Outpatient Trial —
the longest and largest at-home trial of a hybrid closed-loop insulin pump
system — a device that is a step towards an artificial pancreas.
The randomised control trial, which is still looking for more participants,
involves testing an automated insulin delivery system to see if it is better
at optimising blood glucose levels than standard therapy.
Participants are randomised — 50/50 split — to use the pump and even though
Phillip did not get to use it, he said he would not hesitate to be involved in
research again as he found the experience overwhelmingly positive.
“Being involved in research means that my blood glucose levels are watched
more closely and I can keep my HbA1c under control,” he said.
“I didn’t really mind when I wasn’t selected to wear the system as I still got
a lot out of the trial — being selected would have been an extra bonus.
“I would take part in research again because I’ve come out of the trial with a
better understanding of diabetes and how to better manage my blood sugar
The young people’s Hybrid Closed-Loop Outpatient Trial team is led by
Professor Tim Jones, co-director of the Children’s Diabetes Centre at the
Telethon Kids Institute in Western Australia and paediatric endocrinologist at
In New South Wales, it is led by Professor Geoff Ambler at Westmead Children’s
Hospital in Sydney and Dr Bruce King at Newcastle at John Hunter Children’s in
Newcastle. Other paediatric hospitals involved in the trial include Royal
Children’s Hospital (Melbourne) and the Women and Children’s Hospital
The Hybrid Closed-Loop Outpatient Trial is funded by the Type 1 Diabetes
Clinical Research Network, an innovative clinical research program led by JDRF
Australia and funded by a Special Research Initiative through the Australian
