... The importance of physical activity as you age
# The importance of physical activity as you age
It’s inevitable…we all get older! And as we age, our bodies change resulting
in the decline of both our physical and cognitive function. But why do some
people seem to age “better” than others? Obviously differences in our genetic
make-up play a big role, but our lifestyle can play an equally important role.
Research has shown that the more time you spend sedentary (inactive), the
greater the risk for cardio-metabolic disorders. Findings also suggest that
sedentary behaviours are strongly associated with _lower_ odds of successful
ageing. So the first step in “better” ageing is to reduce sedentary time –
think of all those activities you do sitting, like watching TV, reading books,
driving, knitting…the list can go on and on. How can you reduce time spent on
these activities and/or break up these activities over your day?
It has been estimated that about half of the physical decline associated with
ageing may be due to a lack of physical activity! Without regular physical
activity, people over the age of 50 can experience a wide range of health
problems. Unfortunately, many adults fall short of achieving the recommended
levels of physical activity. In fact, 56% of Australian adults are either
inactive or have low levels of physical activity - that is more than 9.5
million adults who are increasing their risk of what may be preventable health
The good news is, that it’s never too late to become physically active and
positively impact your health! Research suggests that regular physical
*_prevent_ complications for those who already have a chronic disease; and
Find below some of the impacts of ageing and how exercise can help!
* Increase likelihood of developing Type 2 diabetes
* Lead to muscle loss which effects the bodies capacity to store and use glucose
* Reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and associated complications
* Assist in regulating blood glucose levels and therefore improve diabetes management
* Increase glucose uptake, usage and storage by muscles
* Reduce the elasticity & increase in stiffness of arteries
* Increase risk of heart attack and stroke
* Improve the strength and efficiency of heart
* Reduce total cholesterol & LDL (bad cholesterol)
* Reduce muscle strength and power and increase the risk of falls
* Cause muscle tissue to be replaced with tough, fibrous tissue
* Lead to the development of poor posture
* Reduce one’s ability to live an independent life
* Improve muscle strength and power and reduce falls risk
* Enhance the ability to perform activities of daily living and maintain independence later in life
* Assist with improving body composition (more lean muscle, less fat)
* Increase the risk of an inactive lifestyle leading to bone wastage
* Hormonal changes (e.g. menopause) can trigger loss of minerals in bone tissue
* Increase the risk of fractures and Osteoporosis
* Strengthen bones and slow the rate of bone and mineral loss (strength training is particularly effective at this)
* Reduce the risk of falls, fractures and Osteoporosis
* Lead to thinning and stiffening of cartilage
* Increase the risk of inflammatory joint issues like osteoarthritis
* Help increase synovial fluid, keeping joints lubricated
* Reduce arthritis symptoms such as pain and inflammation
* Strengthen muscles surrounding joints to provide added support ****
* Reduce coordination, slow movement and decrease balance
* Reduce ability to perform activities of daily living that rely on these motor skills
* Help increase synovial fluid, keeping joints lubricated
* Reduce arthritis symptoms such as pain and inflammation
* Strengthen muscles surrounding joints to provide added support ****
* Lead to an increase in fat mass and reduction in muscle mass
* Assist in burning extra kilojoules, increase muscle mass and speed up the metabolism, which helps to maintain a healthy weight
* Cause structural changes such as decrease in size of the brain
* Affect cognition such as reduced memory, orientation, language and attention
* Cause chemical changes such as altering the level of certain neurotransmitters
* Improves circulation and feeds the brain with nutrient rich blood
* Increase the brain’s ability to build new brain cells
* Reduce the risk of Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease
