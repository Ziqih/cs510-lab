>>>>>>> ### We've supported research to develop the artificial pancreas since
the beginning. And we're committed to making this technology a reality for as
>>>>>>> The artificial pancreas, or closed-loop insulin delivery system,
continuously monitors blood sugar levels, calculates the amount of insulin
required (through a device such as a tablet or mobile phone), and
>>>>>>> It's known as the 'artificial pancreas' because it monitors and
adjusts insulin levels just as the pancreas does in people without diabetes.
>>>>>>> The technology has the potential to change lives, making living with
diabetes easier and helping people achieve more stable blood sugar levels.
>>>>>>> In 1977 we purchased the UK’s first artificial pancreas to help
Professor Sir George Alberti stabilise blood sugar levels for people with Type
>>>>>>> It was the size of a filing cabinet. Since then we've carried on
backing research to improve this technology, and have seen exciting advances.

>>>>>>> Prof Hovorka has led on world-first artificial pancreas research
>>>>>>> Our scientist Professor Roman Hovorka at the University of Cambridge
worked on the first artificial pancreas prototype. With our funding, he tested
it in a world-first trial, which saw 24 people with with Type 1 diabetes using
the device in their own homes for a month.
>>>>>>> We got the results in 2014. People using the system spent 13.5% more
time with their blood sugar levels in the ideal range, compared to people
using standard insulin therapy. They also had lower average overnight blood

every day of the trial with blood glucose levels in target range was something
new for me, and gave me a sense of stability I don’t get just by using the

available for everyone with Type 1 diabetes, ongoing research like this is
taking us closer to breakthrough moments in treating this condition."
>>>>>>>> Mark Wareham, who benefited from artificial pancreas research
>>>>>>> ## Benefits for pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes
>>>>>>> A few years later we backed another world-first trial. Professor Helen
Murphy investigated how the artificial pancreas could help women with Type 1
diabetes during pregnancy, where managing the condition is even more
>>>>>>> In 2016, Professor Murphy’s trial showed the device was safe and
improved blood sugar control in 16 expectant mums who took part, and, most

pancreas. It was managing my condition and worry away.

>>>>>>> ## And people with Type 2 diabetes during hospital stays
>>>>>>> We funded Professor Hovorka to carry out one of the first trials of
the artificial pancreas with people with Type 2 diabetes. The results, in
2018, showed that the device could transform the care some people with Type 2

involved 136 people with Type 2 diabetes who needed insulin to manage their

with blood sugar levels in the target range, compared to people using insulin
>>>>>>> ### The artificial pancreas isn’t available yet
>>>>>>> The closed-loop artificial pancreas is still being tested in research
>>>>>>> For now, the closest thing available is the Medtronic MiniMed™ 670G.
This is known as a hybrid closed-loop system. The pump automatically adjusts
your background, or basal, insulin based on your blood sugar readings. But you
still need to tell the device when, and the amount of carbohydrate, you're
