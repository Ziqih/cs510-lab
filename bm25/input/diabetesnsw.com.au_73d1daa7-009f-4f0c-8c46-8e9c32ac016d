# The Great Ocean Road Trek: Cassandra's story
At the age of 22, Cassandra’s life was changed forever. Following a car
accident, Cassandra was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Cass has continued to
manage her condition for the past 15 years. In an endeavour to bring hope to
others living with diabetes, Cass signed up to an event she had dreamt of for
some years – the Great Ocean Road Trek.
“I have faced many challenges in managing the disease, knowing all too well of
the highs and lows that can go with it. I knew it would not only be physically
and mentally rewarding for me, but would bring light to many others.”
Covering 100km over seven days, the Great Ocean Road Trek allows participants
to take in the breathtaking scenery of Victoria’s rugged coast. Participants
comment on the spectacular beauty of the trek and their delight at hearing
echoes of birdsong as they wind their way through forests, rocky shores,
The accomplishment of this dream wasn’t easy by any means for Cass. The
relentless nature of type 1 diabetes management is even more challenging while
undertaking physical exercise. With bumps along the road, Cass’s demonstration
of resilience became even more inspiring. Having travelled from Adelaide to
Victoria and being parted from her young foster children to participant, Cass
had her heart set on reaching the Twelve Apostles.
“The trek was one of the most memorable experiences for me and something I’m
so proud to have done. To anyone living with diabetes who is thinking of doing
this trek … do it, you have all the support.”
 _Are you ready for the adventure of a lifetime?_ The next Great Ocean Road
Trek runs from 15 to 21 October 2020.
