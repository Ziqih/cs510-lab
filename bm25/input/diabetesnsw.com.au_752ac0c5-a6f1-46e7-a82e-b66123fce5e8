## How to use the Health Star Rating to make healthier choices
Reading food labels can be tricky. To make it easier for consumers The Health
Star Rating (HSR) was launched. The HSR is a symbol that food companies can
choose to display on the front of their packaging, which gives foods a rating
out of five stars. Customers can use this symbol to **compare similar food
products** and help them choose the healthiest option.
## How do they calculate each star rating?
Food manufacturers calculate star ratings for their products based on a set of
rules. Products can lose or gain points, depending on the nutrients they
Products gain points if they contain fruits, vegetables, legumes or healthy
nutrients like fibre. However, they lose points if they contain "risk
nutrients". Risk nutrients are parts of food that contribute to weight gain or
can be harmful to our health, such as saturated fat, added salt and sugars.
The total points at the end are then converted into a star rating.
## How you can use the HSR to help you make healthier choices?
The HSR allows you to compare products within the same category. For example,
you could compare two different types of muesli bars, or two different brands
of yoghurt, but you can't compare yoghurt with muesli bars. In this way, if
you were looking to buy breakfast cereal and deciding between a cereal with
two and a half stars and a cereal with four stars, the product with four stars
It's important to take this rating with a grain of salt. Remember, even if you
choose the healthier option, you should also consider your portion size and
what you serve with that product (e.g. type of milk, extra fruit or toppings
Overall, it's important to remember that the HSR is only used for processed
and packaged foods. This can be a big help for busy people that need a hand
deciphering food labels when they are on the go. Before you reach for packaged
foods however, aim to fill up on fresh **unprocessed** wholefoods from the
core foods groups. For more information on building a healthy, well-balanced
diet based on the core food groups, visit eatforhealth.gov.au. Diabetes NSW &
