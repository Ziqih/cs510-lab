We often hear about how eating a balanced diet and doing some form regular
physical activity is important in maintaining our health long term,
particularly when it comes to managing diabetes. There is an increasing amount
of evidence that suggests there is another central player influencing our
health that we should be take into equal consideration – sleep. Sleep is vital
to many of our bodily functions and with an estimated 45% of Australian’s
suffering from inadequate sleep, it is something worth paying attention to.
Sleep has a profound effect on brain function and is critical for the growth
of new brain cells and formation of new connections. Getting adequate sleep
helps with memory and learning, particularly in the way it allows our brains
to filter out and store the important bits of information we have gathered
throughout the day and store these to memory.
Our brains also use sleep as an opportunity to flush out toxins that have
accumulated throughout the day. Some of these toxins, called beta-amyloids,
are associated with an increased risk of brain disorders like of Alzheimer’s
disease. Other aspects of brain function like attention, creativity and
decision-making ability are also heavily dependent on adequate sleep.
Sleep has a significant influence over our physical health as well. Not only
is it essential for the growth and repair of our muscles and other cells
throughout our body, it also strengthens our immune system and improves our
ability to fight infection. Interestingly, sleep also helps to maintain the
balance between the hormones which regulate our feelings of hunger and
fullness in relation to food. Poor sleep has been shown to affect this balance
which to some extent may explain why there is an increased risk of obesity
## What happens when we don’t get enough sleep?
We all might know through experience that a lack of sleep can affect our
ability to make decisions, solve problems and our general mood and ability to
control our emotions. Sleep deprivation has a significant effect on our
cognitive functions and performance. A recent survey of Australians showed
that sleepiness and sleep problems are a major source of risk on our roads
with 20% of people reporting they “nodded off” while driving at some point.
Perhaps less reported is the negative affects shortened sleep time has on our
metabolic health and our ability to control blood glucose levels. Sleeping
less than 6-7 hours per night has been shown to increase our risk of obesity,
## How does not enough sleep affect diabetes?
Ongoing sleep loss has been shown to lead to glucose intolerance (difficulty
breaking down glucose) and insulin resistance (insulin not working
effectively) – both of which lead to an increase in blood glucose levels. This
effect on the balance of blood glucose levels (glycaemic control) can almost
double someone’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes, as well as make it
increasingly difficult to manage the condition for people living with
Research has also shown that not catching enough z’s, or being sleep-deprived,
can increase our appetite and lead us to crave comfort foods rich in fat and
carbohydrates. It is estimated that being sleep deprived can increase our
total daily energy intake by approximately 20%. Additionally, the fatigue and
tiredness that comes with not getting enough sleep means we are less inclined
to exercise. It can be easy to see why not getting enough sleep over the long
term will increase someone’s risk of gaining weight, which in turn makes it
even more difficult to control blood glucose levels.
Our bodies need for sleep will vary on an individual basis. Factors such as
age and your genetics can have a large influence, however 7-8 hours sleep is
generally considered normal in the adult population. You can generally tell if
you are sleeping enough by how well you function during the day.
Interestingly, over-sleeping can have a similar impact on our health to under-

* Avoiding large meals, caffeine and alcohol before bed is also recommended
* Try to be consistent with the time you go to bed and wake up.
Regular exercise or physical activity is another effective way of improving
your sleep, whilst also helping reduce blood glucose levels. Research has
shown that these benefits can be experienced straight away with exercise
having an acute positive impact on sleep. These benefits are even greater when
we exercise on a regular basis and have been shown to reduce the amount of
time it takes up to get to sleep (sleep latency), as well as increase the
Aiming for 30 minutes of some form of physical activity per day is a great
place to start to experience these benefits. Some great tips can be found on
