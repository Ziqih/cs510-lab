A blood glucose monitoring earring that measures levels and delivers feedback
in real time was among the finalists at the 2020 Global Grad Design Awards in
The Sense Glucose Earring (Sense) designed by 22-year-old Tyra Kozlow is a
non-invasive blood glucose monitor that could revolutionise how patients
The glucose monitoring earring requires a single lobe piercing which
incorporates safe high-frequency radio-waves that penetrate through the lobe
and provides data on the characteristics of the blood.
Unlike some of the other glucose monitors on the market, the design does not
Once the blood is monitored, Sense sends an alert the user about their current
