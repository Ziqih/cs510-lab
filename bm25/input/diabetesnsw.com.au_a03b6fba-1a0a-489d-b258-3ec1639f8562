# Cure for type 1 may lie in our eyes
## Could the cure for type 1 diabetes lie in the eyes of the beholder?
Scientists have discovered the eyes hold a different immune system to the body
which could lead to a breakthrough for type 1 diabetes.
It has long been known that the immune system of humans does not have the same
access to the eye - or the testis, brain and placenta for that matter – as it
does to other organs of the body. However, only as of recently have scientists
and researchers started looking into the possibility of using this “immune
privilege” in their pursuit of a cure for type 1 diabetes. The eye is not only
interesting to researchers guided by Per-Olof Berggren PhD, professor in
experimental endocrinology at Karolinska Institute in Sweden, because of its
potential to act as a shield, but also because it is the only perfectly
So what does all this mean? Essentially, this means that instead of injecting
insulin into the body through the bloodstream, people living with type 1
diabetes could transplant pancreatic islet cells into their eyes, protecting
the new cells from being attacked by the immune system.
The transparency allows scientists to see into the body, observing the
integrity and survival of the islets, as well as how the immune system
Type 1 diabetes is caused by our immune system destroying beta cells that
The program, called _Living Window_ , has had some success in mice and
baboons, but has also revealed that the eye is not fully ‘privileged.’ While
immune invasion in the eye is much lower than in other parts of the body, it
Diabetes NSW& ACT said that the research was nevertheless full of promise.
Key findings are that the eye is attacked with much less aggression than other
organs and that we have full view of the body responding. This is fantastic
research and could be a real turning point in the plausible cure for type 1
