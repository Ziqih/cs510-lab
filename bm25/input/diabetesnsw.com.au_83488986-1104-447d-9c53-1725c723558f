##**Why are there delays in getting my regular medications?**
You may have already experienced a delay in receiving your medication supplies
from your pharmacy as it may be taking a little extra time for your pharmacy
to receive medications from their wholesaler. Pharmacies, as well as
individual customers, have had limits placed on ordering during the COVID-19
pandemic. This is to stop panic buying and unhelpful stockpiling of
medications by individuals and pharmacies. Placing limits will ensure
You will be limited to 30 days supply of your medications with each
dispensing. Due to the current delays, we suggest you take your prescriptions
into the pharmacy one week before you need to pick up your medication and pick
them up only when you need them. In rural areas delivery may take extra time
due to the high demand on freight services.
##**How can I get my medications if I have been told to self-isolate?**
Pharmacies can enrol in government subsidised delivery of your prescription
items. This is limited to one delivery per month. Deliveries can be through
pharmacy staff or Australia Post. If you need your medications to be
delivered, it is sensible to get all of your monthly medications supplied at
the one time. If you need an extra delivery your pharmacy may charge you a
##**What if I can’t get my medication by the time I need the next month’s
If a medication does become unavailable, your pharmacist has the discretion to
contact your doctor for supply of an alternative or to change strengths and
##**A friend suggested I have Ventolin on hand for respiratory symptoms of
Ventolin (Salbutamol puffer) is a rescue medication for people living with
lung conditions such as asthma. If you currently do not have a condition in
which your lung function is compromised, seeking supply of these medications
will not assist you. If you experience symptoms please contact your health
provider or call HealthDirect Australia on 1800 022 222. Stockpiling these
medications will reduce the access of others who need this medication. We are
recommending that people with lung conditions also not stockpile Ventolin to
##**What is happening with NDSS products as I couldn’t get my supply
NDSS subsidised products such as insulin pump supplies, continuous glucose
monitoring, Freestyle libre sensors and blood glucose monitoring strips should
Your pharmacy may not have immediate stock on hand due to the high demand
placed on stock. Stock pre-ordered through the NDSS system in your pharmacy is
likely to be available within two working days as usual. In rural areas it may
take extra time due to the high demand on freight services.
##**Should I use Ibuprofen if I get a fever and symptoms?**
Paracetamol is suggested for fever and pain as a result of a COVID-19
infection. Please note that paracetamol cannot be taken by all people. If you
have not taken paracetamol before or are unsure if it is suitable for you
please check with your health professionals before taking this medication.
Reports have suggested that Ibuprofen may not be the best option for pain and
fever for COVID-19 symptoms. This recommendation is based on theory and a
small observational study in China. It is not a proven fact as yet.
The dose of paracetamol must not exceed 4 grams or eight regular tablets
(500mg each) a day; two tablets up to four times a day. If using extended
release paracetamol (665mg), take two tablets up to three times a day. Please
check that you are not receiving paracetamol from other sources such as cough
and cold medications and Lemsip. If you are taking these products add that
amount into your daily amount. Do not exceed 4 grams of paracetamol per day in
total. The dose you use may be reduced if you have liver problems – ask your
GP. Follow the dosage recommendations for children and infants recommended on
the liquid/ soluble or chewable preparations for their weight/age and do not
Paracetamol may interfere with the reading of continuous glucose monitoring.
Please confirm readings out of range with additional blood glucose monitoring
by fingerprick. Freestyle Libre and blood glucose monitoring may not be
affected by paracetamol usage. Remember, any illness, stress, anxiety, or
change in diet and exercise will impact glucose levels.
