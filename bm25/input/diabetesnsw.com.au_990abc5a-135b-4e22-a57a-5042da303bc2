# GDM diagnosis being missed in rural areas
A new study by the University of Western Australia, Kimberley Aboriginal
Medical Services and member services has found that a number of pregnant women
in rural and remote areas may be missing out on being diagnosed with
gestational diabetes (GDM) due to problems with blood testing.
Associate Professor Julia Marley from UWA’s Medical School said it was
possible that two out three women with gestational diabetes may have been
missed during the study due to problems with the collection tubes used to
Associate Professor Marley, Principal Research Fellow with The Rural Clinical
School and Principal Research Officer with the Kimberley Aboriginal Medical
Services based in Broome, said an oral glucose tolerance test was routinely
Patients must fast for eight hours before taking the test, which is usually
done first thing in the morning. Blood tests are taken before the sugar drink,
one hour later and then finally two hours after drinking.
“We know a lot of women find the sugar drink test hard and many just don’t
want to do it so we wanted to see if we could make it easier to test for
“During the study we found that there were problems with the way blood sample
tubes were stored before they were tested. To get correct sugar results, the
blood tubes need to be put straight on ice until they are tested and testing
needs to happen within one hour of the last blood sample taken but this is not
“Instead blood samples are put in tubes that contain an additive (fluoride) to
stop cells in the blood sample from using sugar. However, this takes four
hours to work so when the blood gets tested there is less sugar.
“We wanted to explore this further to see if usual practice affects sugar
results and if we are missing women with gestational diabetes.”
Clinic staff from partner health services recruited 694 women from 27 clinics
across regional, rural and remote WA from Kununurra to Albany to take part in
the ORCHID study (Optimisation of Rural Clinical and Haematological Indicators
As part of the ORCHID study the researchers took a little extra blood at the
same time as normal blood tests during the woman’s first antenatal visit and
when the sugar drink tests were done. The extra blood was used to test for
“We found out how much the blood sugar result dropped by getting women to give
blood samples that could be tested quickly,” Associate Professor Marley said.
The researchers kept blood sample tubes taken from the women at room
temperature (usual clinical practice), on ice (research grade) and in a
different blood sample tube that is better at keeping sugar stable (FC Mix
They found the sugar results didn’t change in the blood samples that were put
in FC Mix tubes, which were easier to use than putting samples on ice to stop
“While more women might be told they have gestational diabetes when we use
these types of blood tubes, it will allow the health clinics to provide better
care for the pregnant woman with a plan that includes a special diet, exercise
The research team is now planning to meet the Royal College of Pathologists of
Australasia to discuss updating its guidelines for blood sample collection for
