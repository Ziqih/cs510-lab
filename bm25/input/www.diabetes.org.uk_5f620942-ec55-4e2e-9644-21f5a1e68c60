## Campaigning locally and nationally for better treatment
### How have you been involved in the past year?
Advocating and raising awareness on social media and through our blog by
sharing various campaigns. Writing to my MP and local CCG about various areas
of concern in my area. Helping as part of the moderating team on the Diabetes
UK forum to support people living with diabetes all over the UK. One online
awareness activity that had an unexpectedly large effect was when I spent a
day posting on Facebook every single time I interacted with my diabetes as
part of World Diabetes Day. So many people I know who have no contact with
Type 1 diabetes had no idea about the complexities of what was involved in the
### What events/talks have you attended and organised?
Within the past 12 months I've been invited to speak to healthcare

### What has been the highlight of the past year? Have you learned/experienced
While not specifically a Diabetes UK event, I would say that one of my
highlights this year was certainly TADtalk. It was a great opportunity to hear
some great speakers with really inspiring stories, and to meet people face-to-
face that I have known through online peer-support for many years. It was
great to see Diabetes UK, JDRF and INPUT involved in it too.
Sometimes it is difficult to find the time that you'd like to spend when life
gets busy, and sometimes it's difficult and daunting to know how to make a
start - but I find it very rewarding whenever I do.
### Why would you recommend volunteering with Diabetes UK? What do you enjoy
It's an opportunity to give a little back. To stand alongside other people who
are facing the same struggles every day and to try make Type 1 diabetes a
little easier to live with. One of the best thing about it is getting to know
people - either face-to-face or virtually. It has made me think about my own
diabetes completely differently, and I have learned so much from it.
