1. Preheat oven to 220C and lightly dust a flat baking tray with a little flour.
2. Sift flour into a large bowl, add cinnamon, mixed spice and nutmeg and use your fingertips to rub in the butter until mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
3. Add sultanas and milk. Mix until mixture forms a soft dough.
4. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently (not too much or scones will be tough).
5. Flatten dough to 2cm thick. Cut into square and place on baking tray 1cm apart.
6. Brush with a little milk and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the scones are golden in colour.
While scones are cooling, melt some white, milk, or dark chocolate (whatever
you have or prefer) and spoon into a plastic bag. Cut off the corner of the
bag to create a small hole and pipe a cross onto each scone. Enjoy!
